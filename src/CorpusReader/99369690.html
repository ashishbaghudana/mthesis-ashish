				<p id = "s2s1p1">Adenoviruses encode proteins that block responses to interferons, intrinsic cellular apoptosis, killing by CD8 (+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes and killing by the death ligands TNF, Fas ligand and TRAIL. The viral proteins are believed to prolong acute and persistent adenovirus infections. The proteins may prove useful in protecting adenovirus gene therapy vectors and transplanted cells from the immune system.<\p>
