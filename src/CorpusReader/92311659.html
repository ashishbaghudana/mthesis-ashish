				<p id = "s2s1p1">The genes and mechanisms that control programmed cell death are currently the subject of intense study. The bcl-2 gene, a repressor of lymphocyte death, is perhaps the best understood of the programmed cell death associated genes. Here, Stanley Korsmeyer provides a brief overview of bcl-2, concentrating on its roles in B- and T-cell development and in oncogenesis.<\p>
