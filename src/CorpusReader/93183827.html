				<p id = "s2s1p1">The assessment of synovial lymphocyte reactivity to adenovirus antigen stimulation was undertaken in patients with persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis. The 3H-thymidine uptake procedure was employed, incorporating multiple microbiological antigens. Five patients were found with repeated maximal responses to adenovirus antigen; in one of these adenovirus nucleotide sequences were present in a synovial biopsy specimen. It is concluded that adenovirus may be one cause of persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis.<\p>
