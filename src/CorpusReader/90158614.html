				<p id = "s2s1p1">In this work, the mixed leucocytes were further separated into mononuclear (MNL) and polymorphonuclear (PML) leucocytes, and GCR were determined in each part of leucocytes. GCR on MNL and PML in 6 Yang deficient patients were 3473 +/- 413 and 4433 +/- 651 sites/cell respectively, statistically significant from the normal control group (4462 +/- 962 and 5622 +/- 782 sites/cell respectively, P less than 0.05). GCR on MNL, PML and mixed leucocytes in 5 patients were determined simultaneously, and all lowered from the control group. The results were 3369 +/- 370, 4986 +/- 419 and 4524 +/- 852 sites/cell respectively, with the lowest GCR on MNL and highest on PML.<\p>
