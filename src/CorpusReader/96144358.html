				<p id = "s2s1p1">From a murine B-cell cDNA-library we have cloned a cDNA encoding the murine B-cell specific coactivator mBob1. The protein is the murine homologue to the recently described human coactivator Bob1 (hBob1), also referred to as OBF-1 or OCA-B. We have also characterized the genomic mBob1 clone. Analysis of its intron-exon structure has allowed identification of a C-terminal splice variant. mBob1 is B-cell restricted, and is found in all B-cell lines representing different stages of B-cell differentiation. mBob1 interacts with the octamer transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 and stimulates transcription mediated by these factors.<\p>
