				<p id = "s2s1p1">The sex-determining gene SRY was screened for molecular alteration in an XY sex-reversed female by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique. An A-to-G transition was detected which leads to an exchange of a tyrosine by a cysteine in the SRY protein. The affected tyrosine residue located at the C terminus of the DNA binding protein is evolutionarily strongly conserved among the members of the HMG box containing proteins. Using gel shift assay and peptide synthesis such a mutation is shown to abolish the SRY protein DNA binding ability. The involvement of this particular amino acid in the binding specificity is also discussed.<\p>
