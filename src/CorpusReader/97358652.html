				<p id = "s2s1p1">Irrespective of the etiology, many kidney diseases result in inflammation and fibrosis of the tubulointerstitium, with the subsequent loss of renal function. To initiate any disease process or for any disease process to progress, there must be changes in the transcription of genes within the affected tissue. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors regulates genes involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. This review discusses the NF-kappaB transcription factor family in general and the association of NF-kappaB activation with cellular/molecular events of renal inflammation and fibrosis<\p>
