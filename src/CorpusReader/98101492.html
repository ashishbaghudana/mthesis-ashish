				<p id = "s2s1p1">The process of apoptosis is used to eliminate unwanted cells from a wide variety of organisms. Various extracellular signals, often converging in common intracellular pathways, can induce apoptosis in a cell-type-specific fashion. Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors regulate apoptosis in many cell types. In most cells, Rel/NF-kappa B transcription factors appear to mediate survival signals that protect cells from apoptosis; however, under some circumstances, activation of these factors may also promote apoptosis.<\p>
