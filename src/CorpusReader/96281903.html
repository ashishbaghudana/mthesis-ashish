				<p id = "s2s1p1">Spi-B is an Ets transcription factor related to the oncoprotein Spi-1/PU.1 and highly expressed in B lymphoid cells. The Ets proteins share a conserved Ets domain that mediates specific DNA binding. Spi-B binds DNA sequences containing a core 5'-GGAA-3 ' and activates transcription through this motif. Up to date, the biological function of Spi-B remains unknown. Here, we describe the characterization of an alternatively spliced variant of Spi-B, named deltaSpi-B, which has lost the Ets domain. In B lymphoid cells, deltaspi-B and spi-B mRNAs were present simultaneously in a ratio of around 10 %. DeltaSpi-B product was not able to bind DNA and was recovered in cytoplasmic cellular extracts. We raise the hypothesis that delta Spi-B might affect Spi-B function by recruiting factors involved in Spi-B activity.<\p>
