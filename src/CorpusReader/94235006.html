				<p id = "s2s1p1">Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) negative factor (Nef) has been shown to down-regulate the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in vitro. To define the mechanism of action of the Nef protein, the signal transduction pathways which may be affected in T cells by constitutive expression of the nef gene were examined. Stimulation of T cells with tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional factors to a similar level whether or not the cells expressed the nef gene. On the other hand, stimulation of T cells by mitogens or antibodies to the T-cell receptor (TCR) - CD3 complex resulted in the down-regulation of transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in cells expressing the nef gene compared with cells not expressing the nef gene. Because the Nef protein does not affect the surface expression of the CD3 -TCR complex, we conclude that the Nef protein down-regulates the transcriptional factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 in T cells in vitro through an effect on the TCR-dependent signal transduction pathway.<\p>
