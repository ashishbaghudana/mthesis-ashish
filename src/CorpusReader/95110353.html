				<p id = "s2s1p1">The aim of this present study was to investigate the role of protein kinase C (PKC), downstream of p21ras, in activating interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression. It has been reported that PKC is an effector of p21ras in T cells. Data is presented, using the potent and selective PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8425 and transient expression of a constitutively active ras mutant, which clearly shows that PKC is not downstream of p21ras in the induction of NF-AT and AP-1 transcriptional activity and in the expression of IL-2 in human Jurkat T cells. Reporter gene experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B transcriptional activity is not affected by expression of activated p21ras. The signaling pathways involving PKC activation, calcium mobilization and ras activation combine to provide the necessary components for production of IL-2 during T cell activation.<\p>
