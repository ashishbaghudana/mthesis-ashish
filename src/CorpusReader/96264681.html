				<p id = "s2s1p1">Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a specific type of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the morphology of the blast cells, a specific t (15; 17) translocation, and risks of definite coagulopathy. Recently this leukemia was further characterized by an exquisite sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid 's differentiation effect and the production of a fusion gene altering the gene of RARalpha and a novel gene PML. In vivo differentiation therapy with retinoids in APL patients follows strict guidelines related both to the APL cell and the biodisposal of all-trans retinoic acid.<\p>
