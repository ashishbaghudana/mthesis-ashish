				<p id = "s2s1p1">We report an unusual case of a 55 year old Japanese woman with a seminoma but relatively normal menses. The patient was a phenotypic female with late onset menarche (18 years of age), who was amenorrhoeic for the first year, followed by menses of one to three days ' slight flow with dysmenorrhoea, but an otherwise normal menstrual history. A typical seminoma was removed from the left adnexal region and an immature testis was identified separately as an associated right adnexal mass. Repeated karyotypic studies on peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures showed only 46, X, -Y, t (Y; 15) (q12; p13). Cytogenetic examination of the patient 's younger brother, who had fathered three healthy children, showed an identical karyotype. Mosaicism of 46, X, -Y, t (Y; 15) (q12; p13) /45, X cell lines was found in skin samples from the patient 's elbow and genital regions, although there were no clinical stigmata of Turner syndrome. An androgen receptor binding assay of cultured genital skin fibroblasts was negative. Molecular analysis using Southern blot hybridisation, PCR, and direct DNA sequencing showed that neither the patient nor her brother had a detectable deletion or other abnormalities of Y chromosome sequences, including the SRY (sex determining region of the Y chromosome) gene sequence. These findings suggest that Turner mosaicism of the 45, X cell line may have contributed to this atypical presentation in an XY female, although we can not exclude abnormalities of other genes related to sex differentiation.<\p>
