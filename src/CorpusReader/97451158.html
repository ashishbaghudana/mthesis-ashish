				<p id = "s2s1p1">The Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) is an integral membrane protein which transforms fibroblasts and is essential for EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. LMP-1 has been shown to trigger cellular NF-kappa B activity which, however, can not fully explain the oncogenic potential of LMP-1. Here we show that LMP-1 induces the activity of the AP-1 transcription factor, a dimer of Jun/Jun or Jun/Fos proteins. LMP-1 effects on AP-1 are mediated through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, but not the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway. Consequently, LMP-1 triggers the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain which is known to be activated upon JNK -mediated phosphorylation. Deletion analysis indicates that the 55 C-terminal amino acids of the LMP-1 molecule, but not its TRAF interaction domain, are essential for AP-1 activation. JNK -mediated transcriptional activation of AP-1 is the direct output of LMP -1-triggered signaling, as shown by an inducible LMP-1 mutant. Using a tetracycline-regulated LMP-1 allele, we demonstrate that JNK is also an effector of non-cytotoxic LMP-1 signaling in B cells, the physiological target cells of EBV. In summary, our data reveal a novel effector of LMP-1, the SEK/ JNK / c-Jun / AP-1 pathway, which contributes to our understanding of the immortalizing and transforming potential of LMP-1.<\p>
