				<p id = "s2s1p1">During humoral immune responses, B-lymphocyte activation is followed by differentiation along either the plasma cell pathway or the memory B-cell pathway. Recent studies suggest that CD40-CD40 ligand, OX-OX40 ligand, a group of cytokines and intracellular transcriptional factors may all contribute to B-lymphocyte differentiation control.<\p>
