				<p id = "s2s1p1">The production and characterization of Jurkat cell lines that constitutively express functional human immune deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tat protein, using a BK virus plasmid expression vector and HIV-1 tat cDNA, is described. An increased growth rate of these Jurkat-tat cell lines as compared with control cell lines was observed.<\p>
