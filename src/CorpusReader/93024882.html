				<p id = "s2s1p1">We have biochemically and functionally characterized a new transcription factor, NP-TCII, which is present in nuclei from unstimulated T and B lymphocytes but is not found in nonhematopoietic cells. This factor has a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of NF-kappa B but is unrelated to this or other Rel proteins by functional and biochemical criteria. It can also be distinguished from other previously described lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding proteins.<\p>
