				<p id = "s2s1p1">The TAL-1 gene specifies for a basic domain-helix-loop-helix protein, which is involved in the control of normal hematopoiesis. In human pathology, the TAL-1 gene product is expressed in a high percentage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in the pediatric age range; however, it has not been established whether the expression has a causal role in oncogenesis. In this report, we describe the phenotype of mouse transgenic lines obtained by inducing tal-1 protein expression in lymphoid tissues using the LCK promoter. The survival rate of tal-1 transgenic animals was much lower as compared with control mice. Histopathological analysis revealed lymphomas of T-cell type, often comprising a minor B-cell component. Some mice showed marked splenic lymphocyte depletion. Primary lymphocyte cultures showed partial independence from exogenous growth stimuli and increased resistance to low-serum apoptosis. To further unravel the tal-1 oncogenic potential, a strain of tal-1 transgenic mice was crossbred with p53-/- mice; the survival rate in these animals was reduced by more than one-half when compared with that of tal-1 mice, and histopathological analysis revealed exclusively T-cell lymphomas. These data indicate that TAL-1, expressed in T cells, is per se a potent oncogene, which may exert a key leukemogenetic role in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias.<\p>
