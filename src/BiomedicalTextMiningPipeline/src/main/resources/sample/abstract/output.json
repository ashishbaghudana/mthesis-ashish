This catalase is responsible for the resistance to hydrogen peroxide shown by germinating and outgrowing spores . We demonstrated that katX is also a sigmaB- dependent general stress gene , since it is strongly induced by heat , salt and ethanol stress , as well as by energy depletion . The - 10 and - 35 sequences of the sigmaB- and sigmaF- dependent promoters of katX overlap , and the transcriptional start points used by EsigmaB and EsigmaF differ by only one nucleotide . Our results indicate that the level of KatX level in outgrowing spores depends mainly on EsigmaF , because sigB mutants show normal KatX activity in dormant and outgrowing spores . katX mutants also develop the non- specific resistance to oxidative stress that is typical of glucose- starved cells . Therefore , the physiological role of sigmaB- dependent katX expression remains obscure . The results indicate an overlap between the sigmaB regulon and the sigmaF regulon , and the physiological implications of this overlap are discussed .","title":"The katX gene of Bacillus subtilis is under dual control of sigmaB and sigmaF ."}
