The	O
katX	B-DNA
gene	I-DNA
of	O
Bacillus	O
subtilis	O
is	O
under	O
dual	O
control	O
of	O
sigmaB	B-protein
and	O
sigmaF	B-protein
.	O

The	O
gene	B-DNA
katX	I-DNA
,	O
which	O
encodes	O
a	O
catalase	B-protein
in	O
Bacillus	O
subtilis	O
,	O
is	O
transcribed	O
by	O
EsigmaF	B-protein
in	O
the	O
pre-	O
spore	O
.	O

This	O
catalase	B-protein
is	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
resistance	O
to	O
hydrogen	O
peroxide	O
shown	O
by	O
germinating	O
and	O
outgrowing	O
spores	O
.	O

We	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
katX	B-DNA
is	O
also	O
a	O
sigmaB-	B-DNA
dependent	I-DNA
general	I-DNA
stress	I-DNA
gene	I-DNA
,	O
since	O
it	O
is	O
strongly	O
induced	O
by	O
heat	O
,	O
salt	O
and	O
ethanol	O

The	O

10	O
and	O

35	O
sequences	O
of	O
the	O
sigmaB-	B-DNA
and	I-DNA
sigmaF-	I-DNA
dependent	I-DNA
promoters	I-DNA
of	I-DNA
katX	I-DNA
overlap	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
transcriptional	O
start	O
points	O
used	O
by	O
EsigmaB	B-protein
and	O
EsigmaF	B-protein
differ	O
by	O
only	O
one	O
nucleotide	O
.	O

Our	O
results	O
indicate	O
that	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
KatX	B-protein
level	O
in	O
outgrowing	O
spores	O
depends	O
mainly	O
on	O
EsigmaF	B-protein
,	O
because	O
sigB	B-DNA
mutants	O
show	O
normal	O
KatX	B-protein
activity	O
in	O
dormant	O
and	O
outgrowing	O
spores	O
.	O

katX	B-DNA
mutants	O
also	O
develop	O
the	O
non-	O
specific	O
resistance	O
to	O
oxidative	O
stress	O
that	O
is	O
typical	O
of	O
glucose-	O
starved	O
cells	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
physiological	O
role	O
of	O
sigmaB-	B-protein
dependent	O
katX	B-protein
expression	O
remains	O
obscure	O
.	O

The	O
results	O
indicate	O
an	O
overlap	O
between	O
the	O
sigmaB	B-protein
regulon	O
and	O
the	O
sigmaF	B-protein
regulon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
physiological	O
implications	O
of	O
this	O
overlap	O
