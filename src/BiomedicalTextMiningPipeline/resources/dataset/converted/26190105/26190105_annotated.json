    "abstract": "X- chromosome inactivation is the process that evolved in mammals to equalize levels of X- linked gene expression in XX females relative to XY males . Silencing of a single X chromosome in female cells is mediated by the non- coding RNA Xist . Although progress has been made toward identifying factors that function in the maintenance of X inactivation , the primary silencing factors are largely undefined . We developed an shRNA screening strategy to produce a ranked list of candidate primary silencing factors . Validation experiments performed on several of the top hits identified the SPOC domain RNA binding proteins Rbm15 and Spen and Wtap , a component of the m6A RNA methyltransferase complex , as playing an important role in the establishment of Xist- mediated silencing . Localization analysis using super- resolution 3D- SIM microscopy demonstrates that these factors co- localize with Xist RNA within the nuclear matrix subcompartment , consistent with a direct interaction .",
