					<h3 id="s2h1">Abstract</h3>					<p id = "s2s1p1">Recently , a multiprotein complex was identified that is involved in processing the psaA precursor mRNA . Using coupled tandem affinity purification ( TAP ) and mass spectrometry analyses with trans- splicing factor Raa4 as a bait protein , we recently identified a multisubunit ribonucleoprotein ( RNP ) complex comprising previously characterized trans- splicing factors Raa1 , Raa3 , Raa4 , and Rat2 , plus novel components . Raa1 and Rat2 share a common structural motif , an octatricopeptide repeat ( OPR ) , that presumably functions as an RNA interaction module . Two of the novel RNP complex components also exhibit a predicted OPR motif , and were therefore considered as potential trans- splicing factors . Here , we selected BAC clones encoding these OPR proteins and conducted functional complementation assays using previously generated trans- splicing mutants . Our assay revealed that the trans- splicing defect of mutant F19 was restored by a new factor we named RAA8 ; molecular characterization of complemented strains verified that Raa8 participates in splicing of the first psaA group II intron . Three out of six OPR motifs are located in the C- terminal end of Raa8 , which was shown to be essential for restoring psaA mRNA trans- splicing . Our results support the important role played by OPR proteins in chloroplast RNA metabolism , and also demonstrate that combining TAP and mass spectrometry with functional complementation studies represents a vigorous tool for identifying trans- splicing factors .</p>
