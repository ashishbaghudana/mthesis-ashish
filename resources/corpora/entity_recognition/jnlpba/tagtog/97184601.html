				<p id = "s2s1p1">The region downstream of the enhancer (DEN) of the long terminal repeat of the mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus is important for viral pathogenicity. Another important activity of DEN is its control of transcription in activated T cells, and we have determined that an NF-kappaB site is critical for this activity.</p>
