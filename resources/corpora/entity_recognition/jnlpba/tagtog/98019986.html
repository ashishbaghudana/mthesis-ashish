				<p id = "s2s1p1">Although much is understood about the induction of genes expressed early (within 24 h) after T-cell activation, little is known about the regulation of expression of genes expressed 'late ' (three or more days) post-stimulation. A better understanding of transcriptional regulation at this important stage of T-cell maturation may yield new insights into T-cell development and new immunotherapeutic targets.</p>
