				<p id = "s2s1p1">The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) plays an important role in T-cell biology. Activation of T cells results in the rapid calcineurin -dependent translocation of NFAT transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This translocation process coupled to the subsequent active maintenance of NFAT in the nucleus compartment is critical for the induction of expression of several genes encoding cytokines and membrane proteins that modulate immune responses. The molecular cloning of the NFAT family of transcription factors has facilitated rapid progress in the understanding of the signalling mechanisms that control the activity of NFAT.</p>
