				<p id = "s2s1p1">Eosinophils play an important role in the effector phase of allergic inflammation. This review will focus on the conversion of the unprimed eosinophil phenotype in the peripheral blood of normal individuals to the primed phenotype found in the peripheral blood and tissues of allergic patients, a phenomenon called priming. Recent data on the signals initiated after cytokine receptor activation on eosinophils will be reviewed.</p>
