				<p id = "s2s1p1">Results in two affected infants. We report two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive renal disease. Both patients presented with a salt-losing episode simulating adrenal insufficiency. In one patient, transient reduction of aldosterone receptors could be documented, while in the second patient the clinical and biochemical parameters were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism. Aldosterone receptors were normal in both patients</p>
