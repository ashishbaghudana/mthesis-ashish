				<p id = "s2s1p1">Tissue specific regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a fascinating new field in molecular immunology. This review summarizes data on specific regulation of promoters and enhancers by nuclear trans-acting factors in lymphocytes. The structural classes of transcription factors are described and basic methods for detection and analysis of transcription factors are detailed. Furthermore, the most important trans-acting factors of T and B lymphocytes (e.g. NF-kB, NF-AT and STAT families) and their functional importance are described. Several methods for specific down-regulation of transcription factors are shown that may be relevant to treatment of human disease. The data are discussed with regard to their potential clinical relevance for gastroenterology.</p>
