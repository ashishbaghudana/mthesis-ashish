				<h2 id="s1h1">[ Changes in plasma interleukin-1 and their possible relationship with the changes in glucocorticoid receptor in aged long-distance runner] For the study of the changes in plasma interleukin-1 (IL-1) and their possible relationship with the changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR), plasma IL-1 and GR in peripheral blood leukocytes in aged long-distance runner were measured simultaneously.</h2>

				<p id = "s2s1p1">The activity of IL-1 was expressed as its ability to stimulate 3H-TdR incorporation in the thymocytes of C57 mice. GR was determined by whole cell assay with 3H-Dex. The results showed that the activity of plasma IL-1 in aged long-distance runner was 209 %, 223 % and 145 % of the control at 14.7-18.7, 3.8-7.0 and 1.5-2.6 KD fractions. The GR in peripheral blood leukocytes in aged runner was 65 % of the control. Possible relationship between the changes in IL-1 and GR in aged long-distance runner and its physiological significance are discussed.</p>
