				<p id = "s2s1p1">The study of human disorders known as premature aging syndromes may provide insight into the mechanisms of cellular senescence. The main feature of cellular senescence in vitro is cessation of cell proliferation. Down syndrome (DS) and neuronal ceroid-lypofuscinosis (NCL) are clinically characterized by the premature onset of numerous features normally associated with human aging. Phytohemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes derived from DS subjects showed a statistically significant diminished proliferation capacity in comparison with lymphocytes derived from NCL and healthy individuals. We demonstrated, by applying the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, slightly impaired AP-1 DNA binding activity in NCL lymphocytes and strong in DS ones. Our results showed that the same molecular mechanisms of proliferation cessation could exist in fibroblasts characterized by replicative senescence and in lymphocytes derived from individuals with premature aging syndromes (Down</p>
