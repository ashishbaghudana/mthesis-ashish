					<p id = "s2s1p1">Translational initiation of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) mRNA occurs by ribosomal entry into the 5 ' nontranslated region of the EMCV mRNA, rather than by ribosomal scanning. Internal ribosomal binding requires a cis-acting element termed the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). IRES elements have been proposed to be involved in the translation of picornavirus mRNAs and some cellular mRNAs. Internal ribosome binding likely requires the interaction of trans-acting factors that recognize both the mRNA and the ribosomal complex. Five cellular proteins (p52, p57, p70, p72, and p100) cross-link the EMCV IRES or fragments of the IRES. For one of these proteins, p57, binding to the IRES correlates with translation. Recently, p57 was identified to be very similar, if not identical, to polypyrimidine tract-binding protein. On the basis of cross-linking results with 21 different EMCV IRES fragments and cytoplasmic HeLa extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate as the source of polypeptides, consensus binding sites for p52, p57, p70, and p100 are proposed. It is suggested that each of these proteins recognizes primarily a structural feature of the RNA rather than a specific sequence.</p>
