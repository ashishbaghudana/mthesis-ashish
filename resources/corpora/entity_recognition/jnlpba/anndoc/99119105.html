				<p id = "s2s1p1">Butyric acid (BA) is known to induce overexpression of fetal hemoglobin and then erythroid differentiation. Therefore, BA is currently under clinical investigation as a potential therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease and cancer. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in BA-induced differentiation remain largely unknown. Previous reports have shown that BA-induced overexpression of erythroid genes occurred at the transcriptional level, suggesting the involvement of erythroid transcription factors. Here, we intend to demonstrate the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 transcription factors in the BA-induced erythroid differentiation of human leukemic K562 cells. Time-course experiments showed that nuclear levels of GATA-1 and p45 NF-E2 proteins increased during BA treatment. Moreover, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting either GATA-1 or p45 NF-E2 proteins inhibited both protein expression and BA-induced differentiation. In contrast, BA-induced cell growth inhibition was not affected. These results provide the first direct evidence for the requirement of GATA-1 and NF-E2 in BA-induced differentiation process.</p>
