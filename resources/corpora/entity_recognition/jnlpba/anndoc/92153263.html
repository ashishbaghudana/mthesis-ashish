					<p id = "s2p1">The regulation of gene expression during lymphocyte differentiation is a complex process involving interactions between multiple positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements. In this article, transcriptional regulation of the archetypal T-cell-specific gene, alpha TCR, is discussed. Major recent developments, including the identification of novel families of transcription factors that regulate multiple T-cell genes during thymocyte ontogeny and T-cell activation, are described.</p>
