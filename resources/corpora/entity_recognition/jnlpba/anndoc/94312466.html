					<p id = "s2s1p1">IL-4, a product of the T-helper 0 (Th0) and 2 (Th2) subset, was originally described as a B-cell stimulatory factor and has subsequently been found to suppress IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha gene expression in monocytes stimulated with LPS, and to upregulate IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA) gene expression. In this study we investigated the effect of IL-4 on the expression of cytokine genes in monocytes evoked by other T-helper cell cytokines: IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF. IL-4 down-regulated mRNA accumulation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in monocytes stimulated with IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF. IL-4 also suppressed the IL-2 -induced IL-6 mRNA expression. Temporal analysis of the IL-4 down-regulatory effect on the IL-2-, IL-3-, or GM-CSF-induced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in monocytes provided evidence that IL-4 acts predominantly on the post-transcriptional level. This was supported by the observation that the down-regulatory capacity of IL-4 appeared to be dependent on de novo protein synthesis. IL-4 did not exert significant influence on the induction of expression of IL-1-RA or various CSFs by IL-2, IL-3, and GM-CSF. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>
