					<p id = "s2s1p1">We recently identified a differentiation inhibitory factor (I-factor) in mouse myeloid leukemia M1 cells as a murine homolog of the human nm23-H2 gene product. nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes, although their mechanisms of action are still unknown. Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase activity, it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins. In the present experiment, we examined the effect of nm23 proteins on various differentiation induction systems of human leukemic cells including HL-60, U937, HEL/S, KU812F, K562, and HEL cells. Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL, KU812 and K562 cells, but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60, U937 and HEL/S cells. The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23-H1, -H2, mouse nm23-M1, and -M2 proteins. Moreover, both the mutant nm23-H2His protein and truncated nm23-H2 protein containing N-terminal (1-60) peptide, which do not have NDP kinase activity, also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells. These results suggest that (1) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I-factor/nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells, (2) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity, and (3) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23/NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N-terminal peptides.</p>
