					<p id = "s2p1">Using a modified sperm typing protocol, the mutation frequency of the CAG repeat region at the androgen receptor locus has been measured using a rare semen sample from an individual with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Among 258 X chromosome-containing sperm, 19 % had a repeat number equal to the donor 's somatic DNA (47 repeats), 66 % were expansions and 15 % were contractions. The average expansion was 2.7 repeats. More than half of the expansions involved one or two repeats; the largest was 11 repeats. 68 % of the contractions were also one or two repeats but six (16 %) were very large (12-25 repeats). One contraction generated an allele in an intermediate size range (33-39 repeats). Such alleles have not been observed among more than 900 normal and SBMA X-chromosomes that have been examined. Comparison of the SBMA sperm typing results with mutation frequency data on normal alleles supports the hypothesis that trinucleotide repeat expansions may have a different molecular origin than contractions.</p>
