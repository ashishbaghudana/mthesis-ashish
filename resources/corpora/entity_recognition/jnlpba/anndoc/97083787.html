				<p id = "s2s1p1">The Oct-2 transcription factor is a member of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors and is expressed only in B lymphocytes and in neuronal cells but not in other cell types. The primary RNA transcript of the gene is subject to alternative splicing to yield different variants which can either activate or repress gene expression. The forms produced in B lymphocytes have a predominantly activating effect on gene expression whereas those produced in neuronal cells have a predominantly inhibitory effect and can repress the expression of both the herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes and the cellular tyrosine hydroxylase gene. Thus Oct-2 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular gene expression in both B cells and neuronal cells as well as in the control of viral latency.</p>
