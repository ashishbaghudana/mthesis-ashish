					<p id = "s2p1">The immunoregulatory properties of prolactin, a pituitary peptide hormone, have received renewed attention. The prolactin receptor, a member of the hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily, is ubiquitously expressed by cells in the immune system. Certain subpopulations of lymphocytes synthesize and secrete biologically active prolactin, which suggests that prolactin can act as an autocrine and/or paracrine factor to modulate the activities of cells of the immune system. This review focuses on the molecular actions of prolactin in the immune system. Emphasis is given to recent information about the molecular mechanisms of prolactin receptor signal transduction, and the signaling molecules and prolactin-inducible target genes that participate in these responses. In particular, the prolactin-inducible interferon regulatory factor-1 gene and its roles in mediating diverse immune responses.</p>
