					<p id = "s2p1">RJ 2.2.5 is a human B cell mutant derived from the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell which is defective in the AIR-1 locus function. This locus encodes a transcriptional trans-activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. Here we show, by in vivo DNase I footprinting, that the AIR-1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy. Interestingly, reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2.2.5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern. DRA promoter occupancy in other class II-negative B cell lines, derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome, is drastically different from the one observed in RJ 2.2.5 and Raji cells. Moreover, the use of the DNase I as an in vivo footprinting agent reveals that the patients ' cell lines do not display a completely `` bare promoter `` as previously reported using dimethyl sulfate as the footprinting agent. Thus, the use of DNase I allowed us, for the first time, to correlate the AIR-1 locus defect with class II promoter occupancy alterations and distinguish these alterations from the ones observed in phenotypically similar but genetically distinct MHC class II-negative cells.</p>
