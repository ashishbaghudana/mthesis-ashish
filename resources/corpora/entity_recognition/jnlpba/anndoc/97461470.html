					<p id = "s2s1p1">Human phagocytes recognize bacterial LPS (endotoxin) through membrane CD14 (mCD14), a proinflammatory LPS receptor. This study tested the hypothesis that anti-LPS Abs neutralize endotoxin by blocking cellular uptake through mCD14. Ab-associated changes in the uptake and cellular distribution of FITC-LPS were assessed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy in human CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts (CHO-CD14 cells) and human peripheral blood monocytes. LPS core- and O-side chain-specific mAbs inhibited mCD14 -mediated LPS uptake by both cell types in the presence of serum. O-side chain-specific mAb concurrently enhanced complement-dependent LPS uptake by monocytes through complement receptor-1 (CR1) and uptake by CHO-CD14 cells involving another heat-labile serum factor (s) and cell-associated recognition molecule (s). Core-specific mAb inhibited mCD14 -mediated uptake of homologous and heterologous LPS, while producing less concurrent enhancement of non- mCD14 -mediated LPS uptake. The modulation by anti-LPS mAbs of mCD14 -mediated LPS uptake was associated with inhibition of LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation and TNF-alpha secretion in CHO-CD14 cells and monocytes, respectively, while mAb enhancement of non- mCD14 -mediated LPS uptake stimulated these activities. LPS-specific Abs thus mediate anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory functions, respectively, by preventing target cell uptake of LPS through mCD14 and augmenting uptake through CR1 or other cell receptors.</p>
