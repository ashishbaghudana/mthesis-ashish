					<p id = "s2p1">J delta K cells were isolated as a chronically infected survivor cell line, following infection of Jurkat CD4+ T cells with dl-NF, a mutated strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1( HIV-1) containing a deletion of the long terminal repeat( LTR) NF-kappa B sites. J delta K cells exhibited very low levels of constitutive HIV production. HIV-1 expression was activated from J delta K cells by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate( PMA), sodium butyrate( NaB), or hexamethylene bisacetamide( HMBA), but not tumor necrosis factor alpha( TNF-alpha), confirming the role of NF-kappa B in mediating TNF-alpha induction of HIV transcription. The strong induction of HIV expression by NaB or HMBA in J delta K cells clearly demonstrates the existence of NF-kappa B -independent mechanisms of HIV activation in chronically infected cells. J delta K cells may provide a useful model for characterizing NF-kappa B -independent transcriptional activation of the HIV LTR.</p>
