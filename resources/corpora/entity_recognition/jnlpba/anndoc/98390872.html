					<p id = "s2s1p1">The mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of CyA and FK 506 can be monitored in vivo in humans. The picture emerging is of a close relationship between drug concentrations and CN inhibition. But many puzzles of the drugs remain. What is the role of CyA in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), particularly in relationship to nephrotoxicity and fibrogenesis ? How important are the anti-inflammatory (non T) effects of CyA, and which cells do they operate in ? Are there effects of CyA and FK 506 all attributable to CN inhibition, and how much of them are mediated through the NFATC family of transcription factors ? Finally, it would be useful to know what the inhibitory effects of CyA are on tolerance and negative regulatory events.</p>
