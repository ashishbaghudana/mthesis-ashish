					<p id = "s2p1">The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of early growth response 1 (EGR-1) gene expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells. Differentiation of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of the serine/threonine protein kinase C, was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs. The EGR-1 promoter contains six CC (A/T) 6GG (CArG) motifs. The two 5'-most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility. In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on EGR-1 transcription in a TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant, designated TUR. Treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR-1 transcription through the 5'-most CArG element. Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR-1 expression, we studied activation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases, pp70S6K and pp90rsk. Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth, there was no detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation. Moreover, rapamycin, an inhibitor of pp70S6K activation, had no effect on induction of EGR-1 expression. In contrast, analysis of pp90rsk activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from S6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase in TPA-treated U-937, and not TUR, cells. Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of pp90rsk.</p>
