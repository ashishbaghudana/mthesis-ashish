					<p id = "s2s1p1">The protooncogene p21ras, a monomeric G protein family member, plays a critical role in converting extracellular signals into intracellular biochemical events. Here, we report that nitric oxide (NO) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras. In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible. Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange. The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling, such as NF-kappa B activation, and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell. These studies identify p21ras as a target of the same cell. These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.</p>
