					<p id = "s2s1p1">All human adenoviruses transform rodent cells in vitro, but only cells transformed by serotypes belonging to subgroups A (Ad12) and B (Ad3) are tumorigenic for immunocompetent animals. In these cells, the expression of MHC-class I antigens is repressed and might allow them to escape from recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and to develop in tumor. Furthermore, these cell lines appear resistant to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. To determine the E1A domain (s) responsible for these properties several cell lines were created by transforming baby rat kidney (BRK) cells with a set of plasmids expressing different Ad2/Ad12 hybrid E1A gene products. The MHC class 1 gene expression was inhibited in cells expressing the Ad12 13S mRNA product and in cells transformed with Ad2/Ad12 hybrid E1A gene product harboring the C-terminal part of the conserved region (CR) 3 of Ad12. Susceptibility of these transformed cell lines to NK cells was determined by cytolytic assays. The results obtained suggest that two Ad12 E1A domains are required to induce resistance of the cell lines to NK cells.</p>
