					<p id = "s2p1">[editorial] A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature was conducted using the indexing terms 'immunology, calcitriol and vitamin D ' to identify studies indicating a role for calcitriol as a primary immunomodulator. Sixty-six papers published between January 1956 and June 1991 were identified. Forty-five of these reports are cited in this review. The data strongly suggest an endocrine, autocrine and/or paracrine role for calcitriol in immune regulation. No unifying hypothesis has yet emerged explaining this collection of data. This paper provides a brief review of immune properties currently attributed to calcitriol.</p>
