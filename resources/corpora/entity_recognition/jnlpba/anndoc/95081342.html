					<p id = "s2p1">Cytosols were prepared from lymphocytes of 24 healthy pregnant women( 11 first, 10 second and three third trimester), seven healthy non-pregnant women, nine women with recurrent spontaneous abortion, and six healthy men. In addition, a human breast carcinoma cell line( ZR-75-1), which expresses the progesterone receptor, was analysed throughout. The ZR-75-1 cell line showed an expression of 642 fmol/mg whereas lymphocytes of pregnant women showed an expression < or = 4 fmol/mg. Lymphocytes of non-pregnant women, women with threatened pre-term delivery, and men showed equivalent levels: 3 +/- 1, 3 +/- 2 and 5 +/- 4 fmol/mg respectively. These results show that there is no evidence of specific expression of the progesterone receptor in pregnancy and exclude any prognostic character in spontaneous abortion. A role for the progesterone receptor in the mechanism of the known effect of progesterone on peripheral blood lymphocytes is also excluded.</p>
