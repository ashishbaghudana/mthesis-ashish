					<p id = "s2p1">Activation of NF-kappa B by various cellular stimuli involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor, I kappa B alpha, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the role of serine/threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated. Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations( approximately 1-5 nM) of calyculin A or okadaic acid, potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1( PP-1) and type 2A( PP-2A), induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the absence of any cellular stimulus. This action of the phosphatase inhibitors, which is associated with the activation of the RelA.p50 NF-kappa B heterodimer, is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha( TNF-alpha). Furthermore, the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A-treated cells, but not that from TNF-alpha-stimulated cells, is sensitive to PP-2A in vitro, suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF-kappa B inducers. However, induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF-alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha. We further demonstrate that TNF-alpha- and calyculin A-induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, mediated through both the TNF-alpha -inducible and the PP-2A-opposing kinases, may serve to target I kappa B alpha for proteasome -mediated degradation.</p>
