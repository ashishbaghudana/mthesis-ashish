					<p id = "s2s1p1">A dysfunction in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly attributed to a change in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) functionality, has been implicated in depression. We have measured both lymphocyte GR receptor binding parameters and plasma sialyltransferase activity, as a biochemical marker of GR function, in two groups of patients suffering from depression or schizophrenia and in a group of age- and sex-matched controls. While there was a significant increase in plasma cortisol levels in the depressed group, there were no changes in the lymphocyte GR binding parameters (K (m) and Bmax). There was, however, a significant decrease in the plasma sialyltransferase: cortisol ratio in the depressed group suggesting an inability of the raised cortisol levels to induce enzyme expression and this ratio may provide a useful biochemical marker of cortisol receptor function. Although there was an increase in the plasma activity of the alpha 2, 6 sialyltransferase isozyme in the schizophrenic group, no other changes were determined. Therefore, while the total plasma sialyltransferase: cortisol ratio reflects HPA axis function, alterations in specific isozyme activity may also be associated with other CNS disease states.</p>
