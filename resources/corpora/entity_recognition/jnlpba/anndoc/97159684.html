				<h2 id="s1h1">V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 suppresses interleukin 2 -induced T cell growth [published erratum appears in AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 1997 May 1; 13 (7): 633] We tested the effect of three linear or two loop peptides derived from the V3 region of the HTLV-III BH10 clone or the SF2 strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on IL-2 -driven T cell proliferation.</h2>

					<p id = "s2p1">V3-BH10, which consists of 42 amino acids and has a loop structure, suppressed IL-2 -driven proliferation of all IL-2-dependent cells [Kit225, ED-40515 (+), KT-3, 7-day PHA-blasts, and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells] tested, whereas it did not suppress the cell growth of IL-2-independent cell lines (Hut102, Molt-4, and Jurkat). This suppressive effect was also seen in IL-2 -driven cell growth of CD8-positive lymphocytes purified from 7-day PHA-blasts, indicating that CD4 molecules were not required for the suppression. The treatment with anti-V3 loop monoclonal antibody (902 antibody) completely abolished the suppressive effect of V3-BH10. In addition, V3-BH10 generated the arrest of Kit225 cells and also purified CD8-positive lymphocytes in G1 phase in the presence of IL-2. Neither chromatin condensation nor DNA fragmentation was detected in Kit225 cells cultured with V3-BH10 and IL-2. V3-BH10 neither blocked radiolabeled IL-2 binding to IL-2 receptors nor affected tyrosyl phosphorylation of several cellular proteins (p120, p98, p96, p54, and p38), which is immediately induced by IL-2 stimulation. However, V3-BH10 enhanced IL-2 -induced mRNA expression of c-fos but not c-myc or junB. Thus, the binding of V3 loop of gp120 to the cell surface molecule (s) appears to affect intracellular IL-2 signaling, which leads to the suppression of IL-2 -induced T cell growth</p>
