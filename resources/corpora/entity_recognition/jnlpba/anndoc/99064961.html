					<p id = "s2p1">OBJECTIVE: Many studies have suggested that there is a possible hormonal dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and an increased cortisol clearance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Therefore in this study, we have examined the role of glucocorticoid receptor/s (GR) characteristics in the developing of these abnormalities in patients with PCOS. METHOD: For this purpose, the number and affinity of GR in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) of 10 patients with PCOS and 10 healthy women (controls) were determined. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the number (6500+/-1001 sites/cell and 6352+/-1697 sites/cell, respectively; P > 0.05) and affinity (3.93+/-0.89 nM and 4.49+/-0.71 nM, respectively; P > 0.05) of GR between the PCOS patients and the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the alterations in the HPA axis and in the cortisol metabolism observed in PCOS are not related to GR deficiency.</p>
