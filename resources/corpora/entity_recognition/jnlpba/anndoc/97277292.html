					<p id = "s2p1">Previous work has demonstrated that SLP-76, a Grb2-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, augments Interleukin-2 promoter activity when overexpressed in the Jurkat T cell line. This activity requires regions of SLP-76 that mediate protein-protein interactions with other molecules in T cells, suggesting that SLP-76 -associated proteins also function to regulate signal transduction. Here we describe the molecular cloning of SLAP-130, a SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein of 130 kDa. We demonstrate that SLAP-130 is hematopoietic cell-specific and associates with the SH2 domain of SLP-76. Additionally, we show that SLAP-130 is a substrate of the T cell antigen receptor-induced protein tyrosine kinases. Interestingly, we find that in contrast to SLP-76, overexpression of SLAP-130 diminishes T cell antigen receptor -induced activation of the interleukin-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells and interferes with the augmentation of interleukin-2 promoter activity seen when SLP-76 is overexpressed in these cells. These data suggest that SLP-76 recruits a negative regulator, SLAP-130, as well as positive regulators of signal transduction in T cells.</p>
