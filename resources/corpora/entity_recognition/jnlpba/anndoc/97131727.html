					<p id = "s2p1">The molecular mechanisms of the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on HIV infection in human monocytes as they matured into monocyte-derived macrophages over 7 days were investigated using HIV-1 (BaL), and low passage clinical strains. IL-4 and IL-13 up-regulated the expression of both genomic and spliced HIV mRNA in monocytes cultured on Teflon, as determined by Northern analysis and p24 Ag assay. Using a nuclear run-on assay, IL-4 stimulation was shown to enhance transcription by two- to threefold. IL-4 stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB nuclear translocation and binding before enhancement of HIV RNA expression. Conversely, IL-4 and IL-13 markedly and significantly inhibited HIV replication at the transcriptional level in monocyte-derived macrophages, and this occurred whether these cytokines were added before or after HIV infection. The reversal from stimulation to inhibition occurred after 3 to 5 days of adherence to plastic. IL-4 had no significant effect on HIV reverse transcription. The effect of both cytokines on the monocyte maturation/differentiation (CD11b, CD13, and CD26) and other macrophage markers (CD14 and CD68) was examined. IL-4 enhanced CD11b, but inhibited CD26 expression and delayed CD13 loss. IL-13 had similar effects on CD11b and CD13, but no effect on CD26. Hence, these cytokines do not simply enhance monocyte differentiation, but have complex and slightly divergent effects that impact on HIV replication probably through cell signaling pathways and nuclear factor-kappaB translocation.</p>
