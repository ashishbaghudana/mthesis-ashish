					<p id = "s2p1">HIV-1 infects resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but remains inactive state until subsequent cell activation. We have demonstrated that the cross-linking of cell surface CD4 by gp120-anti-gp120 immune complexes or heat-inactivated HIV-1 (iHIV-1) is sufficient to trigger activation signals leading to virus reactivation (9). In this study, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and stimulation of virus production by iHIV-1 were strictly linked to the concentrations of viral proteins used as exogenous stimuli. Moreover, we further investigated the physiologic relevance of these observations. When submitted to an in vitro CD4 cross-linking by iHIV-1, PBMCs from HIV-1-infected patients were found to produce virus. This viral reactivation was associated with increased NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in patients ' PBMCs. Additionally, virus reactivation in resting PBMCs infected in vitro with HIV-1 was found to be specifically induced by ligands of the CDR2-loop in domain 1 (D1) of CD4 (virus envelope and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies). In contrast, virus reactivation was not observed following CD4 oligomerization by antibodies that bind other epitopes in D1, including the D1/CDR3-loop. Finally, soluble CD4 (sCD4) prevented virus reactivation by D1/CDR2-loop ligands. Our results indicate that the signaling events initiated in PBMCs by oligomerization of CD4 at the D1/CDR2-loop can trigger HIV-1 upregulation in infected individuals.</p>
