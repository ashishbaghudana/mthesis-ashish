					<p id = "s2p1">Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) hormone-binding activity was studied by a whole-cell method in mononuclear cells (MNC) from peripheral blood of 7 patients during the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis. 4 patients were receiving dopamine, which did not affect the GR count. The patients ' plasma cortisol concentrations were normal or slightly elevated. Despite a wide range, the mean GR count and affinity in MNC from septic patients did not differ from those in normal controls, suggesting that glucocorticoids could still be effective in the hemodynamic compensatory phase of sepsis.</p>
