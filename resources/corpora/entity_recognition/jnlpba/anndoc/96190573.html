					<p id = "s2s1p1">Herpesvirus saimiri is a lymphotropic herpesvirus capable of immortalizing and transforming T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Immortalized and transformed T cells harbor several copies of the viral genome as a persisting genome. The mapping of the cis-acting genetic cis-acting segment (oriP) required for viral episomal maintenance is reported here. Viral DNA fragments that potentially contain oriP were cloned into a plasmid that contains the hygromycin resistance gene. After several round of subcloning followed by transfection, oriP was mapped to a 1.955-kb viral segment. This viral fragment permits stable plasmid replication without deletion or rearrangement as well as episomal maintenance without integration or recombination. The function of oriP depends on a trans-acting factor (s) encoded by the viral genome. The 1.955-kb viral segment includes a dyad symmetry region located between two small nuclear RNA genes and is located upstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene homolog. Therefore, this oriP contains novel elements distinct from those of other DNA viruses.</p>
