					<p id = "s2p1">The chimeric gene, AML1/ETO (MTG8), generated in t (8; 21) acute myeloid leukemia enhances the expression of Bcl-2. To evaluate whether this enhancement is the primary role of AML1/ETO in leukemogenesis, effects of over-expression of Bcl-2 in the murine myeloid precursor cell line, 32Dcl3, were examined. When 32Dcl3 cells expressing exogenous Bcl-2 were induced to differentiate, the onset of morphological differentiation was delayed. However, even the cells expressing very high levels of exogenous Bcl-2 eventually underwent differentiation without a significant decrease in the synthesis of Bcl-2. On the contrary, 32Dcl3 cells stably expressing AML1/ETO were completely resistant to differentiation and continued to grow in the presence of G-CSF. These results are consistent with the interpretation that stimulation of Bcl-2 expression is not the primary target of AML1/ETO.</p>
