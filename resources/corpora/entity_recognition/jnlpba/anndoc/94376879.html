					<p id = "s2s1p1">The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A blocks a calcium-dependent signal from the T-cell receptor (TCR) that normally leads to T-cell activation. When bound to cyclophilin, cyclosporin A binds and inactivates the key signalling intermediate calcineurin. To identify potential cellular homologues of cyclosporin A that might regulate calcium signalling, we have cloned human genes encoding cyclophilin B-binding-proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. One gene product, when overexpressed in Jurkat T cells, specifically induced transcription from the interleukin-2 enhancer, by activating the T-cell-specific transcription factors NF-AT and NF-IL2A. This protein, termed calcium-signal modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML), acts downstream of the TCR and upstream of calcineurin by causing an influx of calcium. CAML appears to be a new participant in the calcium-signal transduction pathway, implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signalling, even in the absence of cyclosporin.</p>
