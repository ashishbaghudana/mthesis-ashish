					<p id = "s2p1">Fas ligand (FasL) on cytotoxic lymphocytes is important for mediating apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and other target cells. We have reported that NK cell functions, such as proliferation, cell death, and killing activity, are subject to regulation by cellular redox status. Here, we report that expression of FasL protein and mRNA in activated NK cells is also regulated by redox. Ligation of CD16 on IL-2-preactivated NK cells resulted in reduction of intracellular peroxide level as well as induction of FasL expression. This CD16 -induced FasL expression was suppressed by oxidative stress, including thiol deprivation or treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Addition of thiol-reducing compounds, such as L-cystine, 2-ME, or N-acetyl cysteine, restored FasL expression. These data suggest that CD16 stimulation requires cellular reducing status for FasL induction in NK cells. Because FasL gene activation following CD16 cross-linking is regulated by the NF of activated T cells (NFAT), we examined the effect of oxidative stresses on NFAT activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that both thiol insufficiency and H2O2 treatment suppressed DNA-binding activity of NFAT and that addition of thiol-reducing compounds reversed or even enhanced it. Furthermore, these oxidative stresses inhibited activity of calcineurin, a serine/ threonine phosphatase that regulates NFAT activation. These results suggest that suppression of calcineurin and NFAT activation is a mechanism by which oxidative stress inhibits FasL induction in activated NK cells and further support the hypothesis that thiol-reducing compounds might be required for maintenance of optimal NK functions under physiologic oxidative conditions.</p>
