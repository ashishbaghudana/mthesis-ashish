					<p id = "s2p1">Diminished glucocorticoid receptors do not result in glucocorticoid resistance. OBJECTIVE. Lymphocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have diminished receptor density; thus, patients with RA should show partial resistance to glucocorticoids. We investigated the glucocorticoid sensitivity of lymphocytes in RA patients compared with healthy subjects. METHODS. We determined the effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine release. RESULTS. Proliferation and cytokine release were inhibited in RA patients to the same extent as in healthy controls. CONCLUSION. Diminished receptor density in RA patients does not result in glucocorticoid resistance.</p>
