					<p id = "s2p1">Immunoglobulin molecules on the surface of a B lymphocyte are the endogenous `` receptors '' to which specific antigens bind. Studies in mice have shown that a monoclonal antibody, conjugated with palmitate to provide a lipid tail, can be inserted into the cell membrane to provide a `` surrogate '' antigen receptor. We have investigated whether a palmitate conjugate of a human monoclonal antibody specific for thyroglobulin (TG) could function as a surrogate TG receptor on blood mononuclear cells separated into fractions enriched for T cells or depleted of T cells (non-T cells). Using flow cytometry, we detected surrogate TG receptors on non-T (but not on T) cells from 11 of 11 individuals studied (5 Hashimoto patients and 6 control donors). In contrast, endogenous TG receptors could only be detected on non-T cells from 1 of 3 Hashimoto patients and from 0 of 4 control donors. Because of the efficient binding of TG by surrogate receptors on non-T cells, we assessed the ability of such cells to present TG to T cells. Proliferation in response to TG was observed in T cells from only 1 of 5 Hashimoto patients. This low frequency of response was no different from that previously detected using cultures of T cells and autologous dendritic cells. Therefore, the successful generation of surrogate receptors on non-T cells is not associated with more efficient TG presentation of T cells. Furthermore, the significance of the present study is that the T cells, not the antigen-presenting cells, are likely to be the limiting element in the T cell proliferative response to TG and other thyroid autoantigens.</p>
