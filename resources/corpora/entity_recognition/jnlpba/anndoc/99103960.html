					<p id = "s2p1">We compared U-937 cell adhesion and adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical venous (HUVECs) and arterial (HUAECs) endothelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TNF and LPS stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) -1 surface expression and adhesion of U-937 monocyte-like cells to HUVECs but not to HUAECs. Antibody studies demonstrated that in HUVECs at least 75 % of the adhesion response is VCAM-1 mediated. Interleukin-1 stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to and VCAM-1 surface expression in both HUVECs and HUAECs. Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked TNF -and LPS-stimulated U-937 cell adhesion to HUVECs. These agents also significantly decreased TNF -and LPS-stimulated increases in HUVEC surface VCAM-1. TNF increased VCAM-1 protein and mRNA in HUVECs that was blocked by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate. However, neither TNF or LPS stimulated VCAM-1 expression in HUAECs. TNF stimulated expression of both intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs, but in HUAECs, only intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was increased. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated no difference in the pattern of TNF -stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB activation between HUVECs and HUAECs. These studies demonstrate a novel and striking insensitivity of arterial endothelium to the effects of TNF and LPS and indicate a dissociation between the ability of HUAECs to upregulate nuclear factor-kappaB and VCAM-1.</p>
