				<p id = "s2s1p1">A human T lymphoid cell line, PEER, dies by apoptosis in the presence of PMA and calcium ionophore. A new gene, TINUR, was cloned from apoptotic PEER cells. The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross-linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex. TINUR belongs to the NGFI-B/nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor. TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI-B/nur77. We also propose that the NGFI-B/nur77 family can be classified into two subtypes.</p>
