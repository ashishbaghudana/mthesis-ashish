					<p id = "s2p1">Immunohistochemical evidence of low proliferative activity and virtual absence of mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Because the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of granulosa cell tumor (GCT) has not been fully explored, routinely processed (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue from 11 GCT, adult type, was investigated immunohistochemically (ABC method) with a broad spectrum of antibodies against various markers, including p53 and Ki-67. All of the tumors exhibited typical morphology, were limited to the ovary (stage I), and 7 cases followed a benign clinical course. RESULTS: All the tumors exhibited strong expression of vimentin, but most other antigens (including smooth muscle actin) were expressed infrequently by a minority of tumor cells or not at all. Tumor cells in 9 GCT expressed inhibin A. All the tumors exhibited very low proliferative activity, fewer than 10 % of the tumor cell nuclei being stained by the antibody MIB-1 (Ki-67 antigen). The antibody D07 revealed marked overexpression of p53 protein in only one tumor. Clinical outcome was not found to be related to immunophenotypic differences. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of GCT should be based primarily on the typical morphology revealed by conventional stains, but additional immunohistochemical staining with a small panel of selected antibodies (for example, against keratin, vimentin, and inhibin A) may be helpful in a few cases. The very low proliferative activity and the lack of overexpression of p53 protein are consistent with the benign clinical behavior of the majority of GCT.</p>
