					<p id = "s2s1p1">This study investigated age-related T cell responses after in vitro exposure to influenza A virus. Mononuclear leukocytes from young or elderly persons were sham-exposed or exposed to influenza virus for 1, 24, and 72 h. Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis were then used to detect T cells producing the transcriptional regulating proteins Fos and Jun. Fewer virus-exposed cells from elderly donors stained for Fos and Jun at each data point compared with cells from young donors. Flow cytometric analysis also showed that at 72 h of virus exposure fewer T cells from the elderly produced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), suggesting a link between the magnitude of the Fos and Jun and IFN-gamma responses. Thus, failure of virus-exposed T cells to produce Fos and Jun could contribute to the increase in illness due to influenza virus in the elderly.</p>
