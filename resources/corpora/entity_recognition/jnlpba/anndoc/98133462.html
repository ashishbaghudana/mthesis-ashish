					<p id = "s2p1">We measured the number of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in cord blood lymphocytes and the binding affinity (Kd) in 15 term and in 20 preterm babies. Thirteen preterms of the latter group received prenatal steroid treatment. Seven preterms developed neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). The number of GR and the Kd were similar in the term and preterm (with and without NRDS) babies. The maximum (3H) -thymidine incorporation into DNA of cord blood lymphocytes from all preterms, with or without NRDS was suppressed when compared to that from term babies or adults. This could partly be explained by the antenatal steroid treatment. Sensitivity (ID50) of the lymphocytes for the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was the same in all groups. In this study on the number and function of GR in lymphocytes, we were unable to find a relation between the functionality of the GR and the development of NRDS.</p>
