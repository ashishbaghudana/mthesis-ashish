					<p id = "s2p1">A new approach to facilitate immobilization and affinity purification of recombinant proteins and selected human B lymphocytes has been developed. Using magnetic beads with attached DNA containing the Escherichia coli lac operator, fusion proteins comprising the DNA-binding lac repressor could be affinity-purified and recovered by gentle elution conditions, such as with a lactose analogue or by enzymatic means using either deoxyribonuclease (DNase) or restriction endonucleases. The results show for the first time that a DNA-binding protein can be used for affinity purification of fusion proteins as exemplified by the specific and gentle recovery of beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase from bacterial lysates using immunomagnetic separation. The approach was further extended to cell separation by the efficient recovery and elution of human CD37 B lymphocytes from peripheral blood.</p>
