					<p id = "s2p1">NF-kappa B is an important transcription factor required for T cell proliferation and other immunological functions. The NF-kappa B1 gene encodes a 105-kD protein that is the precursor of the p50 component of NF-kappa B. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that NF-kappa B regulates the NF-kappa B1 gene. In this manuscript we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which T cell lines stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutin (PHA) display significantly higher levels of NF-kappa B1 encoding transcripts than cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, despite the fact that both stimuli activate NF-kappa B. Characterization of the NF-kappa B1 promoter identified an Egr-1 site which was found to be essential for both the PMA/ PHA -mediated induction as well as the synergistic activation observed after the expression of the RelA subunit of NF-kappa B and Egr-1. Furthermore, Egr-1 induction was required for endogenous NF-kappa B1 gene expression, since PMA/ PHA-stimulated T cell lines expressing antisense Egr-1 RNA were inhibited in their ability to upregulate NF-kappa B1 transcription. Our studies indicate that transcriptional synergy mediated by activation of both Egr-1 and NF-kappa B may have important ramifications in T cell development by upregulating NF-kappa B1 gene expression.</p>
