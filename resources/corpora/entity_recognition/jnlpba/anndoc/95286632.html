					<p id = "s2s1p1">We have identified an in vivo footprint over the PuF site on the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells. The PuF site on the silent normal c-myc allele was unoccupied. We demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay with antibody, UV cross-linking followed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and Western analysis that Nm23H2 in B cell nuclear extracts bound to the c-myc PuF site. Transfection experiments with c-myc promoter constructs in both DHL-9 and Raji cells revealed that the PuF site functioned as a positive regulatory element in B cells with a drop in activity with mutation of this site. Access to this site is blocked in the normal silent c-myc allele; these data suggest that the Nm23H2 protein is involved in deregulation of the translocated c-myc allele in Burkitt 's lymphoma cells.</p>
