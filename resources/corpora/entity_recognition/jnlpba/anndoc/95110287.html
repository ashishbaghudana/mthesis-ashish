					<p id = "s2p1">The cis-acting region, GM-kappa B/GC-box (positions -95 and -73), within the murine GM-CSF gene promoter is required for maximal induction by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore (A23187) in T cells. GM-kappa B defines a binding site for NF-kappa B, and GC-box defines a binding site for three (A1, A2, B) constitutive proteins. We report here that three copies of the GC-box can functionally compensate for the GM-kappa B/GC-box region, suggesting that the GC-motif can function independently of the GM-kappa B motif. The major GC-box binding activity A1 was purified and identified as the transcription factor Sp1. We show that depletion of Sp1 (A1) from nuclear extracts specifically decreases in vitro transcription activity on GM-CSF templates. Since the human GM-CSF promoter has a base difference within the GC-box, we speculate that this may explain why the human promoter is weak and that an upstream enhancer is required for the induction of the human GM-CSF gene.</p>
