				<p id = "s2s1p1">The erythroid transcription factor erythroid factor-1 (EF1) plays a critical role in the transcription of erythroid-specific genes. Here we report the presence of a factor with the mobility and sequence-specific DNA-binding characteristics of EF1 at low abundance in a wide variety of non-erythroid cell types. This is the first report of an EF1 -like activity in non-erythroid cells and indicates that this factor may play a role in the regulation of genes expressed in such cells.</p>
