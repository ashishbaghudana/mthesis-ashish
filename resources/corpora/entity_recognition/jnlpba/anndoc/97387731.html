				<p id = "s2s1p1">Monoclonal antibodies against either monomorphic or polymorphic determinants of class I antigen induced in PBMC and highly purified T lymphocytes the nuclear activity of NF-kappa B/Rel complexes. These included both p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers, recognized by specific antibodies in EMSA. The induced complexes were detectable in extracts of cells incubated with anti-class I monoclonal antibody (mAb) for 1.5 h; the induction was maximal at 5 h, persistent at 16 h and no longer observed at 40 h. The mAb failed to induce NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in cells incubated in the presence of 3, 4-dichloroisocoumarin, an inhibitor of I kappa B-alpha degradation. Together, these results suggest that class I triggering can induce the activity of NF-kappa B/Rel nuclear activity in peripheral blood T lymphocytes, thereby modulating the expression of genes regulated by these transcription factors.</p>
