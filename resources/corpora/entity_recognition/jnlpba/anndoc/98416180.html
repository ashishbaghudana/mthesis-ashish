					<p id = "s2s1p1">Cytokines stimulate granulopoiesis through signaling via receptors whose expression is controlled by lineage-specific transcription factors. Previously, we demonstrated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor mRNA was undetectable and granulocyte maturation blocked in CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) -deficient mice. This phenotype is distinct from that of G-CSF receptor-/- mice, suggesting that other genes are likely to be adversely affected by loss of C/EBPalpha. Here we demonstrate loss of interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor and IL-6-responsive colony-forming units (CFU-IL6) in C/EBPalpha -/- mice. The observed failure of granulopoiesis could be rescued by the addition of soluble IL-6 receptor and IL-6 or by retroviral transduction of G-CSF receptors, demonstrating that loss of both of these receptors contributes to the absolute block in granulocyte maturation observed in C/EBPalpha-deficient hematopoietic cells. The results of these and other studies suggest that additional C/EBPalpha target genes, possibly other cytokine receptors, are also important for the block in granulocyte differentiation observed in vivo in C/EBPalpha -deficient mice.</p>
