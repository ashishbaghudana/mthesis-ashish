					<p id = "s2p1">Monochloramine derivatives are long lived physiological oxidants produced by neutrophils during the respiratory burst. The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine (NH2Cl) on protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC -mediated cellular responses were studied in elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils and human Jurkat T cells. Neutrophils pretreated with NH2Cl (30-50 microM) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is a potent PKC activator. These cells, however, were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation, which induces the respiratory burst by a PKC -independent mechanism. The NH2Cl-treated neutrophils showed a decrease in both PKC activity and PMA-induced phosphorylation of a 47-kDa protein, which corresponds to the cytosolic factor of NADPH oxidase, p47 (phox). Jurkat T cells pretreated with NH2Cl (20-70 microM) showed a decrease in the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain following PMA stimulation. This was also accompanied by a decrease in both PKC activity and nuclear transcription factor- kappaB activation, also without loss of cell viability. These results show that NH2Cl inhibits PKC -mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible PKC activity.</p>
