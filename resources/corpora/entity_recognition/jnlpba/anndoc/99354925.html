					<p id = "s2p1">The primary IL-13 receptor complex on human monocytes is believed to be a heterodimer comprised of the IL-4R alpha chain and the IL-2R gamma chain( gamma( c)) -like molecule, IL-13R alpha1. mRNA levels for IL-13R alpha1, but not IL-4R alpha, were markedly decreased in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages( MDMac), and with increasing time of monocytes in culture correlated with the loss of IL-13 regulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production. Analysis of cell lines Daudi and THP-1 that differentially express gamma( c) and IL-13R alpha1 showed that IL-13 can activate STAT6 in IL-13R alpha1-positive THP-1 cells but not in gamma( c) -positive, IL-13R alpha1-negative Daudi cells. IL-13 activation of STAT6 was reduced in MDMac which was associated with diminished IL-13 -induced expression of CD23 and MHC class II. However, with reduced IL-13R alpha1 expression and low nuclear STAT6 activity, some IL-13 -induced responses were unaltered in magnitude in MDMac. In the absence of functional IL-13R alpha1 and gamma( c), IL-13 must signal through an alternative receptor complex on MDMac. Experiments with a blocking antibody to IL-4R alpha showed that this chain remains an essential component of the IL-13 receptor complex on MDMac.</p>
