					<p id = "s2s1p1">Death-inducing ligands (DILs) such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin have been shown to activate a nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) -dependent program that may rescue cells from apoptosis induction. We demonstrate here that TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), a recently identified DIL, also activates NFkappaB in lymphoid cell lines in a kinetic similar to TNFalpha. NFkappaB activity is independent from FADD, caspases, and apoptosis induction. To study the influence of NFkappaB activity on apoptosis mediated by TRAIL, CD95, TNFalpha, or doxorubicin, NFkappaB activation was inhibited using the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-L-norleucinal or transient overexpression of mutant IkappaBalpha. Sensitivity for induction of apoptosis was markedly increased by these treatments in apoptosis sensitive cell lines. Moreover, both in cell lines and in primary leukemia cells that are resistant towards induction of apoptosis by DILs and doxorubicin, antagonization of NFkappaB activity partially restored apoptosis sensitivity. These data suggest that inhibition of NFkappaB activation may provide a molecular approach to increase apoptosis sensitivity in anticancer treatment.</p>
