					<p id = "s2p1">Interleukin-9 receptor (IL-9R) complex consists of a ligand-specific alpha chain and IL-2R gamma chain. In this study, two regions in the cytoplasmic domain of human IL-9Ralpha were found to be important for IL-9 -mediated cell growth. A membrane-proximal region that contains the BOX1 consensus sequence is required for IL-9 -induced cell proliferation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinases (JAKs). Deletion of this region or internal deletion of the BOX1 motif abrogated IL-9 -induced cell proliferation and signal transduction. However, substitution of the Pro-X-Pro in the BOX1 motif with Ala-X-Ala failed to abolish IL-9 -induced cell proliferation but decreased IL-9 -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK kinases, insulin receptor substrate-2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and expression of c-myc and junB. Another important region is downstream of the BOX1 motif and contains a STAT3 binding motif YLPQ. Deletion of this region significantly impaired IL-9 -induced cell growth, activation of JAK kinases, insulin receptor substrate-2, and STAT3 and expression of early response genes. A point mutation changing YLPQ into YLPA greatly reduced IL-9 -induced activation of STAT3 and expression of c-myc but did not affect cell proliferation. These results suggest that cooperation or cross-talk of signaling molecules associated with different domains of IL-9Ralpha other than STAT3 is essential for IL-9 -mediated cell growth.</p>
