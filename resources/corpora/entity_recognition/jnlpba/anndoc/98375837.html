					<p id = "s2s1p1">NK cells induce MHC class II molecules on the surface of allogeneic endothelial cells in an adhesion-dependent, IFN-gamma -independent manner. Here, we demonstrate that NK cells induce HLA-DR on the surface of a mutant cell line that is defective in IFN-gamma -induced MHC class II expression. RNA analysis in these cells and in a cell line that is defective in class II transactivator (CIITA) demonstrates that NK cell-induced HLA-DR alpha mRNA expression is also CIITA -independent. The Janus kinase-1-deficient cell line U4A expresses HLA-DR alpha mRNA in response to NK cell activation, and HLA-DR alpha promoter constructs transfected into these cells are induced by NK cells but not IFN-gamma. These data indicate that the IFN-gamma -independent component of the target cell HLA-DR expression induced by lymphocyte adhesion uses a signaling pathway that is distinct from the IFN-gamma -dependent mechanism and also suggest that CIITA is not required.</p>
