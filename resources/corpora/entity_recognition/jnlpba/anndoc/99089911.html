					<p id = "s2p1">Various cellular stress agents like ionizing radiation exposure could activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication or reporter gene expression. In addition, extracellular factor (s) released by X-ray-treated human colonic carcinoma cell line (HT29) might activate the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 in non-irradiated HT29 cells. In the present report we show that in various transiently or stably transfected cell lines, X-ray irradiation up-regulates HIV-1 LTR transcription through the kappaB regulatory elements. A factor (s), which is processed by and acts upon a variety of cell types, was detected by addition to non-irradiated cells of either X-ray-treated cells or a conditioned medium taken from irradiated cultures. The magnitude of responsiveness is cell type dependent. In addition, X-ray activation of HIV-1 LTR in transiently or stably transfected cell lines is inhibited by a potent antioxidant drug, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and by another drug, known for its role in the trapping of growth factors, suramin. The importance of these observations in the pathophysiology of patients with AIDS-related cancers treated by radiotherapy remains to be established.</p>
