					<p id = "s2p1">Cell-to-cell contact between peripheral blood lymphocytes and transfected human colonic carcinoma cell line HT29 activates transcription of the long terminal repeats (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus. HIV-1 LTR transcription is controlled by a complex array of virus-encoded and cellular proteins. Using various constructs expressing a lacZ reporter gene under the control of the intact or three deleted forms of HIV-1 LTR, we obtained evidence that the kappaB regulatory elements located in the U3 region are involved in cell-to-cell activation of HIV-1 LTR. Cell-to-cell contact activates in vitro binding of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p50/p65 heterodimer to an HIV-1 kappaB oligonucleotide. Cell-to-cell contact activation of NF-kappaB was only partially inhibited by 100 microM pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and was not correlated with a significant decrease of cellular inhibitor kappaB alpha. NF-kappaB nuclear activation was not detectable before 1 h after cell contact and was dependent on protein synthesis.</p>
