					<p id = "s2s1p1">We have characterized the human gene encoding LBR, an integral protein of the nuclear envelope inner membrane. Restriction mapping shows that the transcription unit spans approximately 35 kilobases. A transcription start site is located approximately 4 kilobases 5 ' to the translation initiation codon, and an RNA splice of 3863 bases occurs in the 5'-untranslated region to generate mature HeLa cell mRNA. 5 ' to the identified transcription start site are two CCAAT sequences and potential recognition sites for several transcription factors including Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB. There are 13 protein coding exons in the LBR gene. LBR 's nucleoplasmic domain is encoded by exons 1-4, and its hydrophobic domain, with eight putative transmembrane segments, is encoded by exons 5-13. The hydrophobic domain is homologous to three yeast polypeptides, suggesting that this higher eukaryotic gene could have evolved from recombination between a gene that encoded a soluble nuclear protein and a membrane protein gene similar to those in yeast. These results are the first to demonstrate the structural organization of a vertebrate gene encoding an integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope that may be a member of a family of polypeptides conserved in evolution.</p>
