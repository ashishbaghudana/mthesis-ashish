					<p id = "s2s1p1">Human cDNAs encoding Kruppel-type zinc finger domains, designated KOX 1-32, have been cloned from human T lymphocyte cell line libraries. We report here the regional localizations by in situ hybridization of KOX 18 and KOX 25 on chromosome bands 7q21q22. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that these genes are physically located within a DNA fragment of 250 kb. The genes KOX 4 and KOX 9, mapped on chromosome 8q24, were found to be located within a DNA fragment of 450 kb. From the present and previous data, eighteen different KOX genes have been located at least two by two within nine DNA fragments of 200 to 580 kb.</p>
