					<p id = "s2p1">A previously unrecognized element, located downstream of the start site of transcription in the first exon of the DR alpha gene, has been defined that enhances promoter activity up to eightfold in a position-dependent manner. Mutations in this DNA-binding site abolished binding of a nuclear factor in human B cell nuclear extract and decreased the activity of the DR alpha promoter to a basal level. Significant sequence homology of this element was found in the DNA of the DR beta, DP alpha and -beta, and DQ alpha genes, always located downstream of the transcriptional start site. The nuclear factor binds to the DR alpha and DP alpha element but not to the element in the DQ alpha gene. It was identified as NF-E1 (YY1). This protein, previously identified by its binding to the Ig kappa 3 ' enhancer and the Ig heavy chain mu E1 site, thus also appears to be quite important in the regulation of MHC class II gene expression.</p>
