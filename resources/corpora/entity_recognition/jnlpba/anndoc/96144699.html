					<p id = "s2s1p1">An inhibitory, `` dominant-negative, '' form of the calcineurin catalytic (A) subunit was prepared, which lacks the calmodulin-binding domain, autoinhibitory domain and most of its catalytic core but possesses the regulatory (B) subunit binding domain. When tested for its ability to block calcineurin -dependent signaling in Jurkat cells, expression of this `` B-subunit knock-out '' (BKO) construct suppressed reporter gene activity driven by NF-AT, the pivotal promoter element for interleukin (IL) -2 gene induction. Immunoprecipitation of epitope-labeled BKO demonstrated for the formation of a tight complex with endogenous B subunit in Jurkat cells, consistent with an inhibitory mechanism that involves the sequestration of the B subunit. Furthermore, the sharply reduced NF-AT activity produced by co-transfecting BKO could be `` rescued '' by overexpression of transfected B subunit, suggesting that depletion of this subunit was responsible for the inhibition. These data suggest the potential utility of agents that disrupt calcineurin -mediated signal transduction pathways by blocking formation of the catalytically active dimer of calcineurin A and B subunits.</p>
