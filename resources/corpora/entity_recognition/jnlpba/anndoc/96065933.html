					<p id = "s2s1p1">To determine if New World primates express an inhibitor that influences glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding characteristics, we examined[ 3H] dexamethasone binding in cytosol prepared from B95-8 lymphoid cells, derived from the cotton top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), in combination with cytosol prepared from human or rat tissues. B95-8 cytosol inhibited specific binding of[ 3H] dexamethasone (P < 0.01) when mixed with cytosol prepared from either a human lymphoid cell line (HL) or rat thymus. The inhibitory activity was heat labile and trypsin sensitive. Peak inhibitory activity was found in the 150-200 kd fractions after Sephacryl G-200 ultrafiltration. Scatchard analysis of[ 3H] dexamethasone binding using mixed cytosol showed a diminished GR apparent binding affinity when compared to HL cytosol. Kinetic studies using mixed cytosol indicated that B95-8 cytosol did not affect the apparent dissociation rate of[ 3H] dexamethasone. These data demonstrate that B95-8 cells contain a competitive inhibitor that prevents binding of dexamethasone to its cognate receptor.</p>
