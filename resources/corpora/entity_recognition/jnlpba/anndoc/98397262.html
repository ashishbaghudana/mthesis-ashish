					<p id = "s2s1p1">We used our monoclonal model of germinal center maturation, CL-01 B cells, to investigate the role of CD30 in human B cell differentiation. CL-01 cells are IgM + IgD + CD30 + and switch to IgG, IgA, and IgE when exposed to CD40L and IL-4. Switching is hampered by CD30 coengagement, possibly through interference with the CD40 -mediated NF-kappaB -dependent transcriptional activation of downstream C (H) genes. The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar CD30 -mediated effects in naive B cells. Expression of CD30 by these cells is induced by CD40L but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and/or exposure to IL-6 and IL-12. Our data suggest that CD30 critically regulates the CD40 -mediated differentiation of non-antigen-selected human B cells.</p>
