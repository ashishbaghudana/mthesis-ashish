				<p id = "s2s1p1">Activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is essential for T cell receptor (TCR) responsiveness; however, the function of individual PTK substrates is often uncertain. A mutant T cell line was isolated that lacked expression of SLP-76 (SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kilodaltons), a hematopoietically expressed adaptor protein and PTK substrate. SLP-76 was not required for TCR -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins, but was required for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1), as well as Ras pathway activation. TCR -inducible gene expression was dependent on SLP-76. Thus, coupling of TCR-regulated PTKs to downstream signaling pathways requires SLP-76.</p>
