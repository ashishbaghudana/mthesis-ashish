					<p id = "s2p1">Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is produced by T lymphocytes and known to support B cell growth and eosinophilic differentiation of the progenitor cells. Using ATL-16T cells which express IL-5 mRNA, we have identified a region, within the human IL-5 gene promoter, that regulates IL-5 gene transcription. This cis-acting sequence contains the core binding motif, (A/T) GATA (A/G), for GATA-binding family proteins and thus suggests the involvement of these family members. In this report, we describe the cloning of human GATA-4 (hGATA-4) and show that hGATA-4 selectively interacts with the -70 GATA site within the IL-5 proximal promoter region. By promoter deletion and mutation analyses, we established this region as a positive regulatory element. Cotransfection experiments revealed that both hGATA-4 and PMA/A23187 stimulation are necessary for the IL-5 promoter activation. The requirement of another regulatory element called CLE0, which lies downstream of the -70 GATA site, was also demonstrated. ATL-16T cells express mRNA of three GATA-binding proteins, hGATA-2, hGATA-3 and hGATA-4, and each of them has a potential to bind to the consensus (A/T) GATA (G/ A) motif. However, using ATL-16T nuclear extract, we demonstrated that GATA-4 is the only GATA-binding protein that forms specific DNA-protein complex with the -70 GATA site. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay with extracts of COS cells expressing GATA-binding proteins showed that GATA-4 has the highest binding affinity to the -70 GATA site among the three GATA-binding proteins. When the transactivation ability was compared among the three, GATA-4 showed the highest activity. These results demonstrate the selective role of GATA-4 in the transcriptional regulation of the IL-5 gene in a circumstance where multiple members of the GATA-binding proteins are expressed.</p>
