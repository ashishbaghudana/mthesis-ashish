					<p id = "s2s1p1">We have recently demonstrated that hydrocortisone and other glucocorticoids inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by mononuclear (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL). Since NF-kappaB/ IkappaB system regulates the transcription of proinflammatory genes, including those responsible for ROS generation, we tested the hypothesis that hydrocortisone may stimulate IkappaB production thus inhibiting NF-kappaB translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus in MNC, in vivo. One hundred milligram of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously into 4 normal subjects. Blood samples were obtained prior to the injection and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hr after the injection. Nuclear extracts and total cell lysates were prepared from MNC by standard techniques. IkappaB levels in MNC homogenates increased at 1 hr, peaked at 2-4 hr, started to decrease at 8 hr, and returned to baseline levels at 24 hr. NF-kappaB in MNC nuclear extracts decreased at 1 hr, reached a nadir at 4 hr, gradually increased at 8 hr and returned back to baseline levels at 24 hr. The total protein content of NF-kappaB subunit (P65) in MNC lysates also showed a decrease following hydrocortisone injection. This decrease was observed at 2 hr, reached a nadir at 4 hr, and returned to baseline levels at 24 hr. ROS generation inhibition paralleled NF-kappaB levels in the nucleus. It was inhibited at 1 hr, reached a nadir at 2-4 hr, started to increase at 8 hr, and returned to basal levels at 24 hr. Our data demonstrate that hydrocortisone induces IkappaB and suppresses NF-kappaB expression in MNC in parallel. IkappaB further reduces the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus thus preventing the expression of proinflammatory genes.</p>
