				<p id = "s2s1p1">TSC2 is a gene on chromosome 16p13.3 associated with the autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). By using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned TSC2 and polymerase chain reaction methodology, we constructed a digoxigenin-labeled complementary DNA probe to examine TSC2 gene expression in autopsy- or biopsy-derived human tissues by in situ hybridization. TSC2 messenger RNA was widely expressed in various cell types throughout the body, including epithelia, lymphocytes, and cells with endocrine functions, e.g., adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary. It was prominently and selectively (within the central nervous system) expressed in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and other motor neurons, e.g., in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei. Visceral TSC2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without TSC; TSC2 messenger RNA expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover, e.g., epithelia and lymphocytes, with central nervous system pyramidal cells and other neurons being an obvious exception, and/or in cells with important secretory/transport functions. This widespread expression of the TSC2 gene supports the view that it encodes a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism or one that functions as a tumor/growth suppressor.</p>
