					<p id = "s2p1">Type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta), in addition to IL-12, have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human, but not mouse, Th cells. We show here that IFN-alpha/beta act directly on human T cells to drive Th1 development, bypassing the need for IL-12 -induced signaling, whereas IFN-alpha can not substitute IL-12 for mouse Th1 development. The molecular basis for this species specificity is that IFN-alpha/beta activate Stat4 in differentiating human, but not mouse, Th cells. Unlike IL-12, which acts only on Th1 cells, IFN-alpha/beta can activate Stat4 not only in human Th1, but also in Th2 cells. However, restimulation of human Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN-alpha does not induce the production of IFN-gamma. These results suggest that activation of Stat4, which is necessary for the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 cells, is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of human Th2 cells.</p>
