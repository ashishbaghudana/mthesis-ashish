					<p id = "s2p1">Co-stimulation of T-lymphocytes by T-cell receptor( TcR) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2( IL-2) production. The increase in IL-2 gene expression triggered by CD28 involves a kappa B-like sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the IL-2 promoter, called CD28-responsive element. Stimulation of T-cells by agonistic anti-CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate( PMA) - or TcR -derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Here we report that CD28 engagement, however, exerts opposite effects on the transcription factor AP-1. Whereas anti-CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans-activation activity of NF-kappa B, PMA-induced activation of AP-1 was significantly suppressed. The inhibitory effect exerted by anti-CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter-gene assays. These results suggest that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T-cell activation.</p>
