					<p id = "s2p1">We have found that purified human peripheral-blood granulocytes express constitutively significant levels of proto-oncogenes c-jun, jun B and jun D mRNA. Upon functional activation of granulocytes by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the levels of c-jun, jun B and jun D transcripts were increased. The three jun genes showed a similar time course in their induction by PMA, maximal mRNA levels being reached after 60 min of induction. These results suggest that expression of c-jun, jun B and jun D genes might be involved in terminal granulocyte differentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality.</p>
