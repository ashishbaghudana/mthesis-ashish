					<p id = "s2p1">Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a cytokine that is expressed primarily in activated T cells. Here we identified an inducible T cell-specific enhancer 14 kb upstream of the IL-3 gene that responded to activation of T cell receptor signaling pathways. The IL-3 enhancer spanned an inducible cyclosporin A-sensitive DNase I-hypersensitive site found only in T cells. Four NFAT-like elements exist within the enhancer. The two most active NFAT-like elements were located at the center of the DNase I-hypersensitive site. One of these NFAT-like elements encompassed overlapping Oct- and NFATp/c-binding sites, which functioned in a highly synergistic manner. We suggest that the T cell-specific expression of the IL-3 gene is partly controlled through the enhancer by cooperation between Oct and NFAT family proteins.</p>
