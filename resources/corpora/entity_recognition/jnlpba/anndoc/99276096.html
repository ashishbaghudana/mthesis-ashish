					<p id = "s2s1p1">Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax transforms normal T-cells in the presence of interleukin (IL) -2 in vitro. STAT is a family of transcription factors that play a pivotal role in cytokine-induced functions of a various type of cells. We investigated the involvement of STATs in the transformation of T-cells by HTLV-1. HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed higher amounts of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells. The expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax. IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT5 of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation. In contrast, IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STAT5. The expression of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest that the induction of STAT1 and STAT5 by Tax enhances cytokine -induced functions of virus-infected T-cells, hence the induction may play a role in IL-2 -dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1.</p>
