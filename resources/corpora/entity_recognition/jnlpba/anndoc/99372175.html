					<p id = "s2s1p1">Said anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal parameters were compared with the index of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor selected as a prognostic factor. A significant correlation between high lymphocytic infiltration (2.5 points), low body mass and fat was identified. Also, smoking contributed to loss of body mass and fat; however, it caused lymphocytic infiltration to rise. Moderate body mass, relatively low fat level and positive receptor status are among factors of good prognosis in breast cancer of early stages.</p>
