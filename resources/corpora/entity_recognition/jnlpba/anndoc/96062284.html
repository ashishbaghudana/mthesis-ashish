					<p id = "s2p1">The Ca (2+) -dependent phosphatase calcineurin, a target of FK506 and CsA, synergizes with PKC -induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) -kappa B in T cell lines. We have investigated whether this synergy is present in other cell types and the mechanism (s) by which these two pathways lead to NF-kappa B activation. While this synergy is present in other cell types, in the monocytic cell line U937 calcineurin is also sufficient to activate NF-kappa B. Having previously shown that Ca (2+) - and PKC-dependent pathways synergize by accelerating the degradation of IkB alpha, we focused on the regulation of IkB alpha phosphorylation. While PKC -dependent pathways sequentially result in the phosphorylation and in an incomplete degradation of IkB alpha in T cell lines, co-activation of Ca (2+) -dependent pathways accelerates the rate of IkB alpha phosphorylation and results in its complete degradation. Activation of Ca (2+) -dependent pathways alone do not result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of IkB alpha in Jurkat T or in U937 cells. Treatment of T cells with the selective PKC inhibitor GF109203X abrogates the PMA-induced IkB alpha phosphorylation/degradation irrespective of activation of Ca (2+) -dependent pathways, but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB alpha induced by TNF-alpha, a PKC -independent stimulus. Contrary to the interaction with PKC, Ca (2+) -dependent pathways synergize with TNF-alpha not at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation, but at the level of its degradation. These results indicate that Ca (2+) -dependent pathways, including the phosphatase calcineurin, participate in the regulation of NF-kappa B in a cell specific fashion and synergize with PKC -dependent and -independent pathways at the level of IkB alpha phosphorylation and degradation.</p>
