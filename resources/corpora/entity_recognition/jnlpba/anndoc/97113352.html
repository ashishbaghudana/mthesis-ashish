					<p id = "s2p1">The transcription factors Sp1 and PU.1 prime the CD11b promoter, but the nature of the factors responsible for its inducible expression are unknown. In addition to the CD11b gene, the homologous genes encoding CD11a and CD11c also exhibit inducible expression during myeloid differentiation. Therefore, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c gene promoters to identify common elements that might contribute to inducible expression. This analysis identified one such element repeated four times within the CD11b promoter. Mutation of these elements indicated that two, MS-2beta and MS-2gamma, are critical to the induction of the CD11b gene during differentiation of the pro-monocytic cell line U937. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that MS-2beta and MS-2gamma interact with nuclear factors that are induced during U937 differentiation. These factors are detected at the time the CD11b promoter is activated. The molecular mass of these factors is approximately 28 kDa, and their DNA binding characteristics are indistinguishable from those of the novel nuclear factor MS-2. Taken together, our data indicate that MS-2 mediates induction of the CD11b gene as cells of the monocytic lineage mature. The presence of multiple potential binding sites for MS-2 in the promoter regions of a wide range of genes expressed in mature myeloid cells suggests this factor plays a general role in myeloid differentiation.</p>
