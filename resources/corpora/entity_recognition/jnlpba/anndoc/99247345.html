					<p id = "s2p1">TNF is one of the cytokines secreted by the cells of the immune system. Our data demonstrate that those cell lines lacking capability to form metastatic tumors in vivo are susceptible to TNF induced apoptosis in vitro. However, cell lines with high metastatic potential are resistant to TNF in vitro. Furthermore, the same cell lines were resistant to cytolytic action of other cytotoxic proteins secreted by LAK cells. Our data showed that TNF resistance in vitro correlates with the increased level of transcription factor NF-kappaB. This finding may provide a tool to improve current protocols of immunotherapy and insights to how tumor cells are or are not killed by LAK cells.</p>
