					<p id = "s2s1p1">The number of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid binding sites was increased in hypertensives vs normotensives. The treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril led to activation of hormone-receptor interactions. There was a more marked rise of the number of receptors in middle-aged (44-55 years) hypertensives vs elderly (61-80 years) subjects after captopril treatment.</p>
