					<p id = "s2p1">The p56 Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be critical for T lymphocyte differentiation and activation. Hence in the absence of p56, T cell receptor triggered activation does not occur. We now provide evidence for a CD2 -based signaling pathway which, in contrast to that of the T cell receptor, is independent of p56. CD2 -mediated interleukin-2 production occurs via activation of Jun kinase in cell lines lacking p56. Jun kinase then facilitates the binding of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers to the AP-1 consensus site and the subsequent transcriptional activity of the interleukin-2 promoter. These data elucidate differences between TCR and CD2 signaling pathways in the same T cells.</p>
