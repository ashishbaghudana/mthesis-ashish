					<p id = "s2s1p1">Heat-shock for 2 hours at 42 degrees C, or the administration for 3 hours of 100 or 150 microM cadmium chloride, inhibited the subsequent proliferation activity, induced the expression of functional differentiation markers, and caused an increase in the amount of the stress-responsive HSP70 protein in U-937 human promonocytic cells. In addition, both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the intermediate filament protein vimentin, as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays. By contrast, the amounts of actin and beta-tubulin were not significantly altered. The amount of vimentin mRNA was also increased during recovery from stress, indicating that vimentin expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level. Although cadmium caused an early, transient stimulation of c-jun and c-fos expression and AP-1 binding activity, heat-shock failed to alter both protooncogene expression and transcription factor binding, indicating that the stress-induced vimentin increase was not the result of AP-1 -mediated transcriptional activation. Finally, it was observed that the rate of decay of vimentin mRNA upon actinomycin D administration was decreased in heat- and cadmium-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells. These results indicate that stress treatments cause an increase in vimentin levels in promonocytic cells, which may be explained at least in part by transcript stabilization.</p>
