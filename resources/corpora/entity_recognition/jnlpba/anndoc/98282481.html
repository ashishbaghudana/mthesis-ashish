					<p id = "s2p1">Pax-5 codes for the transcription factor BSAP which is expressed throughout B cell development except in terminally differentiated plasma cells. Gene targeting experiments in the mouse revealed a differential dependency of fetal and adult B-lymphopoiesis on this transcription factor. BSAP is required for B-lineage commitment in the fetal liver and for progression beyond an early pro-B cell stage in adult bone marrow. The characterization of Pax-5-deficient pro-B cells demonstrated an important role of BSAP in the regulation of the CD19, mb-1 (Ig alpha) and N-myc genes as well as in the developmental pathway controlling VH-to-DHJH recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus. The human PAX-5 gene was recently shown to participate together with the IgH locus in the chromosomal translocation t (9; 14) (p13; q32). This translocation is characteristic of a small subset of non-Hodgkin lymphomas exhibiting plasmacytoid differentiation. The translocated PAX-5 gene is deregulated by the insertion of IgH regulatory elements into its 5 ' region, which may contribute to tumorigenesis by interfering with the shut-down of PAX-5 transcription and thus with the completion of plasma cell differentiation</p>
