					<p id = "s2p1">Role of AP-1- and octamer-binding proteins in control of IL3 gene expression. We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of interleukin 3 (IL3) gene expression in primary human T lymphocytes following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays, Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies, we found that c-Jun, c-Fos, and octamer-binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5'-flanking sequence. Additionally, the region between bases -107 and -59 of the IL3 promoter containing putative AP-2 and Sp1 binding motifs appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene. The data also indicate that CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals. These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes.</p>
