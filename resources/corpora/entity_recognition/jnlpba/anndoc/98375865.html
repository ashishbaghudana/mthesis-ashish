					<p id = "s2p1">Expression of the IL-2 gene requires activation of T cells through stimulation of the TCR and costimulation through accessory receptors. We have found recently that okadaic acid-sensitive Ser/Thr phosphatases are involved in a cyclosporin A-insensitive pathway that selectively transmits costimulatory signals. In this study, we analyzed whether activities of these phosphatases are necessary for the expression of the IL-2 gene. In both activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and activated tumorigenic T cell lines, IL-2 gene expression was blocked at the transcriptional level by okadaic acid. The transcription factors active at the IL-2 promoter were differentially influenced: upon down-modulation of okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases, transactivation by octamer, NF-kappa B, and NF of activated T cells proteins was abrogated, while transactivation by AP-1 proteins was even enhanced.</p>
