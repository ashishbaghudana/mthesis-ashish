					<p id = "s2s1p1">We recently identified the winged-helix transcription factor Trident and described its expression pattern in synchronized fibroblasts. We have now studied Trident expression in cell lines, differentiating thymocytes and in lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood. During T cell differentiation, expression peaked in the actively dividing immature single positive cells. In peripheral blood lymphocytes, expression of Trident mRNA was absent, but could be induced upon stimulation with mitogens in vitro. These observations imply a function for Trident in dividing lymphocytes.</p>
