					<p id = "s2s1p1">A reporter gene under the control of a T-cell antigen receptor element was activated in Jurkat cells by antigen receptor triggering or by a combination of phorbol myristate acetate, which activates protein kinase C, and a calcium ionophore. Both these signals were necessary for expression of the reporter gene. When co-transfected with a construct capable of overexpressing the tyrosine kinase p59fyn, the reporter gene was activated by PMA alone. Thus p59fyn could replace the calcium ionophore but not activation of protein kinase C. The activation by p59fyn plus PMA was blocked by EGTA and by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A.</p>
