					<p id = "s2p1">Two major protein-binding sites within the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat have been identified. One( site B) contained a palindromic sequence with homology to steroid/thyroid hormone response elements but was distinct from previously described binding sites of this class. A novel T-cell protein recognized the palindromic sequence within site B and also bound estrogen- or thyroid hormone-response elements with lower affinity. A 7-base-pair mutation in the site B palindrome, which destroyed protein binding, resulted in increased expression from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in T cells.</p>
