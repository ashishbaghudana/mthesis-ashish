					<p id = "s2s1p1">Although NFAT has been recently shown to be inducible in several non-T immune cells, the NFAT gene family members characterized to date have been isolated only from T cells. To further characterize NFAT function in human B cells and to demonstrate cytokine gene specificity of NFAT proteins, we report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from the Raji B cell line. The cDNA clone encodes a new isoform, NFATc.beta, of the NFAT gene family member NFATc (designated here NFATc.alpha). The amino acid sequence of NFATc.beta differs from that of NFATc. alpha in the first NH2-terminal 29 residues and contains an additional region of 142 residues at the COOH terminus. Northern analysis using a probe encompassing a common region of both isoforms showed two mRNA species of 2.7 and 4.5 kilobase pairs, while an NFATc.beta-specific probe detected only the 4.5-kilobase pair mRNA which was preferentially expressed in the spleen. Transient expression of NFATc.beta was capable of activating an interleukin-2 NFAT-driven reporter gene in stimulated Jurkat cells in a CsA-sensitive manner. However, NFATc.beta neither bound to the kappa3 element (an NFAT-binding site) in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter nor activated the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in cotransfection assays. These data suggest that different members or isoforms of NFAT gene family may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes.</p>
