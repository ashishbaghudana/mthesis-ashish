					<p id = "s2p1">The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells, in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis. Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone, via a calcineurin -dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A. We have previously identified a promoter element, kappa 3, that is required for calcium-stimulated, cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells. Here, we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp, a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription. NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element, and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction. Thus, although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites, it appears to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp. The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes, starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation.</p>
