				<h2 id="s1h1">[ The trend of molecular biology study on eosinophils] Recently, many investigators have been interested in the study on eosinophil biology since genes association with eosinophils such as interleukin-5 or eosinophil granule proteins (EPO, ECP, EDN, MBP, and CLC), were isolated.</h2>

					<p id = "s2s1p1">However, the molecular basis for the commitment of progenitors to the eosinophil lineage has not been determined. The mechanism by which eosinophil-specific genes encoding primary and secondary granule proteins (e.g. ECP, EDN, EPO, MBP, and CLC) are expressed and regulated during eosinophilopoiesis is also unknown. In this paper, I described the characterization of genes encoding eosinophil granule proteins and the mRNA expression of GATA-1 binding transcription factor during eosinophil differentiation.</p>
