					<p id = "s2p1">1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate( TPA) interact synergistically to induce monocytic differentiation of U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. Addition of TPA causes an otherwise ineffective dose of 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 to induce differentiation. The induced differentiation depends on the simultaneous( vs. sequential) presence of both agents. The kinetics of induced differentiation are consistent with a G1 specific cellular response to initiate the metabolic cascade culminating in cell differentiation. The induced differentiation occurs with down-regulation of c-fos protein and an accompanying up-regulation of RB protein expression, consistent with a possible need for up-regulated RB expression to maintain a given differentiated phenotype and suppress transcriptional activators that might typically be associated with proliferation.</p>
