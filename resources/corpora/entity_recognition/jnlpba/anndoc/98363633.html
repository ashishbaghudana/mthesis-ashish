					<p id = "s2p1">In order to study the transcriptional control of 15-LO expression, we have cloned and sequenced the human 15-LO promoter region. The 15-LO promoter is associated with a CpG island at the 5'-end of the gene, and sequence analysis reveals putative Sp1 and Ap2 binding site/s and absence of TATA or CAAT motifs. Transcription is initiated at one major site. Using deletion constructs, we have defined an active promoter region of 1056 bp. Gel-shift assays revealed that transcriptional factor (s) induced only in response to IL-13 treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes bind to the 15-LO promoter DNA. Two regions, DP1 (-140 to -92 bp) and DP2 (-353 to -304 bp) of the promoter were essential for transcription in HeLa cells and human peripheral monocytes. Hela nuclear extracts contained a specific nuclear factor (s) binding to 15-LO promoter DNA which are distinct from those derived from IL-13-treated human peripheral monocyte nuclear extracts. In addition, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) results refined the previous localization of 15-LO to human chromosome 17p13.3.</p>
