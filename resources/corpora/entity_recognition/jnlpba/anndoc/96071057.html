					<p id = "s2s1p1">Retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid, its isomers, and fifty synthetic retinoids (retinobenzoic acids), were tested for differentiation-inducing activity on human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and NB4. A good linear correlation, with an r value of 0.91, between the ED50 values for the differentiation-inducing activity towards HL-60 cells and that towards NB4 cells was found.</p>
