					<p id = "s2s1p1">Here we report the expression of a fork head domain protein in human T helper cells. We cloned and characterized a fork head cDNA from human T helper cell mRNA using differential display RT-PCR. The cDNA contains a 546-nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF) that codes for the carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids (aa) of the recently identified fkhrl1 gene. This ORF does not contain the characteristic DNA-binding domain found in members of the forkhead protein family. In-vitro transcription/translation of this cDNA expressed a protein of approximately 20 kDa. We have generated antibodies that specifically immunoprecipitated the in-vitro-translated 20-kDa protein. This antibody also recognizes in human T lymphocytes a 70-kDa protein corresponding in size to that predicted for the fkhrl1 gene product. The mRNA levels for fkhrl1 is elevated in T helper-induced lymphocytes in comparison to PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes. Further characterization of FKHRL1 and its related family members should shed light on the transcriptional mechanisms of this fork head gene subfamily and their role in T helper cell differentiation and regulation of cell growth.</p>
