					<p id = "s2p1">The 15-lipoxygenase (lox) gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in erythroid cells but also in airway epithelial cells and eosinophils. We demonstrate in this report that the 5 ' flanking DNA of the 15-lox gene contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of non-erythroid cell lines but not in two erythroid cell lines. The element has characteristics of a transcriptional 'silencer ' since it functions in both orientations. The main activity of the silencer has been mapped to the first 900 bp of 5 ' flanking DNA, which contains nine binding sites for a nuclear factor present in non- erythroid cells but not in erythroid cells. These binding sites have similar sequences and multiple copies of the binding sites confer tissue-specific down-regulation when attached to a minimal lox promoter fragment. The 5 ' flanking DNA also contains a cluster of three binding sites for the GATA family of transcription factors.</p>
