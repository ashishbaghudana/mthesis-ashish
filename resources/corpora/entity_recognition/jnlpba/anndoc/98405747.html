					<p id = "s2s1p1">Stimulation of human tonsillar mononuclear cells with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) rapidly induced the activation of distinct nuclear factors with different mobilities, both of which bind the IL-4 response element (IL-4RE) of CD23b promoter as examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Co-treatment of IL-4 and IFN-gamma induced, in addition to the two distinct complexes, a new complex with an intermediate mobility. The IL-4-induced complex reacted with anti-STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) 6, resulting in a supershift whereas the formation of the IFN-gamma-induced complex was inhibited by anti-STAT 1. The intermediate complex appeared to react with both anti-STAT 6 and anti-STAT 1. Although IFN-gamma alone did not induce CD23 mRNA transcription, Northern blot analysis revealed a transient up-regulation of the IL-4-induced CD23 mRNA by IFN-gamma within 2 h of IFN-gamma treatment in these tonsillar cells. The results suggest that the IL-4RE of the IL-4-inducible gene can accommodate both IL-4- and IFN-gamma-activated factors, such as STAT 6 and STAT 1, either in homodimeric or heterodimeric forms and the binding of these different proteins to the respective promoter may play a potential regulatory role in the IL-4 -inducible gene expression.</p>
