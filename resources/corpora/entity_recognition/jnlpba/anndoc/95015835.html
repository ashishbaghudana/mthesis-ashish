					<p id = "s2p1">Terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in vivo is characterized by secretion of Ig and extinction of MHC class II expression on the cell surface. We show that IL-6 signaling leads to marked increases in the synthesis and secretion of Ig in clonal human B cell lines and newly isolated polyclonal B lymphocytes in vitro. The IL-6-induced cells resemble plasma cells in ultrastructure and in reduced expression of surface MHC class II. Enhanced Ig synthesis is a result of coordinated transcriptional activation of Ig genes without promoter or isotype specificity, and differential accumulation of the mRNA encoding the secreted form of Ig heavy chain. It is saturable and subject to negative control when IL-6 stimulation is prolonged. Coordinate with temporal changes in Ig synthesis, the DNA-binding activity and the synthesis of the B cell-enriched transcription factor Oct-2 are regulated. Thus, differentiation of B cells with IL-6 in vitro recapitulates the hallmarks of terminal B differentiation in vivo; Oct-2 may have a role in this process.</p>
