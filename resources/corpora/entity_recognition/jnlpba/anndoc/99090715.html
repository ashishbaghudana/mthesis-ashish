					<p id = "s2p1">Many studies show that monoamine oxidase B in blood cells is a biological marker for personality characteristics such as sensation seeking. The mechanism underlying this association is so far not explored. In the present study we have performed electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to investigate the pattern of protein binding to a 150 bp fragment of the proximal 5'-flanking region of the human monoamine oxidase B gene. We compared the pattern using nuclear extracts from human brain and lymphocytes. Interestingly, a correlation was observed between monoamine oxidase B enzyme activity in blood cells (platelets) and the binding pattern of two uncharacterized transcription factors. These data are well in line with the long-standing notion that interindividual differences in platelet monoamine oxidase may represent differences in expression of the enzyme rather than genotypic variation.</p>
