					<p id = "s2s1p1">In vitro inhibition of NF-kappa B expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) inhibited growth of these culture-adapted Tax-transformed fibroblasts as well as an HTLV-I-transformed human lymphocyte line. In contrast, antisense inhibition of Tax itself had no apparent effect on cell growth. Mice treated with antisense to NF-kappa B ODNs showed rapid regression of transplanted fibrosarcomas. This suggests that NF-kappa B expression may be necessary for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype and provides a therapeutic approach for HTLV-I-associated disease.</p>
