					<p id = "s2p1">Activation through the Ca2+/ calcineurin pathway is essential to the transcription of many cytokine genes. The conserved cis-acting sequence, GGAAAA, and transcription factors binding to this sequence are involved in the response to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Here we report the identification and importance of the same sequence in a non-cytokine gene, the human T cell receptor gamma( TCRG) enhancer. Results from site-directed mutations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that this sequence mediates the ionomycin-induced activation of the TCRG enhancer. Our studies provide an explanation for a previous observation that TCRG mRNA levels, but not mRNA levels for T cell receptor alpha and -beta, are increased by ionomycin treatment.</p>
