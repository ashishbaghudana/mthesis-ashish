					<p id = "s2p1">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene transcription in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells, leading to IL-8 secretion. The functional analysis of the IL-8 gene revealed that both AP-1- and NF-kappaB factor-binding elements were involved in conferring the responsiveness to CMV. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CMV induced the formation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 complexes. These results suggest that CMV activates these transcriptional factors, resulting in IL-8 gene expression.</p>
