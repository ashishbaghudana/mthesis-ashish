					<p id = "s2p1">CD40 activation of B cells is strongly influenced by the presence of cytokines. However, the molecular basis for the interplay between these distinct stimuli is not clearly delineated. IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor activated by either CD40 or cytokines. We have found that these different sets of signals target a common cis-acting element in the promoter of this gene, the IRF-1 gamma-activated site (GAS). Targeting of the IRF-1 GAS is not confined to activation via CD40 but extends to other stimuli that mimic the CD40 signaling cascade, like TNF-alpha and EBV. In contrast to induction of STATs by cytokines, the IRF-1 GAS -binding complex activated by CD40, TNF-alpha, or EBV contains Rel proteins, specifically p50 and p65. In this system, simultaneous exposure to CD40L together with either IL-4 or IFN-gamma does not lead to the activation of novel Rel/STAT complexes. Given the importance of IRF-1 in a variety of biologic functions from proliferation to apoptosis, our findings support the notion that modulation of IRF-1 levels may be a critical control point in B cell activation.</p>
