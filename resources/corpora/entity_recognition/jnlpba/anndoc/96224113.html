					<p id = "s2p1">The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator (META) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region. Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes, being specific to T cells, dependent on their activation, and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CsA). DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site, META (P), and a promoter-distal site, META (D+), within the 400-base pair META region. Nuclear factors from unstimulated, but not from activated cells, bound a site, META (D-), adjacent to META (D+). META (D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene, and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible, CsA-sensitive T cell factors, in parallel with transfection results. Authentic NFAT and NF-kappaB targets did not compete for the META (D+) binding factor (s). The SV40 core sequence competed for META (D+) binding factors, but META (D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe. Our results, taken together, indicate that META (D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity, activation dependence, and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element. It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas.</p>
