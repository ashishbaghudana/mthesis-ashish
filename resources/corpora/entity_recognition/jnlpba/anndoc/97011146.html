					<p id = "s2s1p1">We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells. Here, we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types. The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and oTAFII110, while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly. All cells tested express TAFII105 mRNA, but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID. Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells. These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type-specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells.</p>
