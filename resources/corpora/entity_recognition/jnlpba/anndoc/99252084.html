					<p id = "s2s1p1">The transcription factor, NF-kappaB, is important for T-cell activation, B-cell maturation, and human immunodeficiency virus transcription and plays a role in alternatively mediating and protecting against apoptosis in a variety of cell types. However, a role for NF-kappaB in human CD34 (+) bone marrow cells has not been described. We provide evidence here that virtually all human CD34 (+) bone marrow cells express NF-kappaB that can be activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and a variety of cytokines, eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In addition, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB may be required for human CD34 (+) bone marrow cell clonogenic function and survival. These results offer insight into a new role for NF-kappaB in maintaining survival and function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and suggest that proposed strategies involving inhibition of NF-kappaB activation as an adjunct to cancer chemotherapy should be approached with caution.</p>
