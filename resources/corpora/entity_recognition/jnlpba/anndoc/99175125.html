					<p id = "s2p1">Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated immune responses, including activation of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells, play an important role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis syndrome. Activation of NF-kappaB is thought to be required for cytokine release from LPS-responsive cells, a critical step for endotoxic effects. Here we investigated the role and involvement of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) signal transducer molecules in LPS signaling in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HDMEC) and THP-1 monocytic cells. LPS stimulation of HDMEC and THP-1 cells initiated an IL-1 receptor -like NF-kappaB signaling cascade. In transient cotransfection experiments, dominant negative mutants of the IL-1 signaling pathway, including MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, and TRAF6 inhibited both IL-1 -and LPS-induced NF-kappaB -luciferase activity. LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation was not inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 that is involved in TNF signaling. LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene was not inhibited by IL-1 receptor antagonist. TLR2 and TLR4 were expressed on the cell surface of HDMEC and THP-1 cells. These findings suggest that a signal transduction molecule in the LPS receptor complex may belong to the IL-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (TLR) super family, and the LPS signaling cascade uses an analogous molecular framework for signaling as IL-1 in mononuclear phagocytes and endothelial cells.</p>
