					<p id = "s2p1">The activity of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) enhancer is restricted to B cells, although it binds both B-cell-restricted and ubiquitous transcription factors. Activation of the enhancer in non-B cells upon overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein E2A appears to be mediated not only by the binding of E2A to its cognate E box but also by the resulting displacement of a repressor from that same site. We have identified a `` two-handed '' zinc finger protein, denoted ZEB, the DNA-binding specificity of which mimics that of the cellular repressor. By employing a derivative E box that binds ZEB but not E2A, we have shown that the repressor is active in B cells and the IgH enhancer is silenced in the absence of binding competition by bHLH proteins. Hence, we propose that a necessary prerequisite of enhancer activity is the B-cell-specific displacement of a ZEB-like repressor by bHLH proteins.</p>
