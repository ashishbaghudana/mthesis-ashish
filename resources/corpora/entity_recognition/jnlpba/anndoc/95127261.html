					<p id = "s2s1p1">We here summarize evidence that thymic atrophy induced by 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can be mediated, at least in part, by damage to extrathymic T-cell precursors in bone marrow and fetal liver. This atrophy induction does not involve apoptotic mechanisms in thymocytes affected by the bcl-2 proto-oncogene. TCDD mediates atrophy induction through its specific receptor (the AhR) and not through effects on the estrogen receptor. Both TCDD and estradiol induce extrathymic T-cell differentiation in the liver. These extrathymic T-cell populations include cells expressing elevated levels of V beta T-cell receptors that are normally deleted in thymic development.</p>
