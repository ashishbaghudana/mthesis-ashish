					<p id = "s2s1p1">The translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia rearranges the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) on chromosome 17. This yields a fusion transcript, PML/RARalpha, a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions in the absence of hormone. Clinical remissions induced with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia are linked to PML/RARalpha expression in leukemic cells. To evaluate the PML/RARalpha role in myelopoiesis, transgenic mice expressing PML/RARalpha were engineered. A full-length PML/RARalpha cDNA driven by the CD11b promoter was expressed in transgenic mice. Expression was confirmed in the bone marrow with a reverse transcription PCR assay. Basal total white blood cell and granulocyte counts did not appreciably differ between PML/RARalpha transgenic and control mice. Cell sorter analysis of CD11b+ bone marrow cells revealed similar CD11b+ populations in transgenic and control mice. However, in vitro clonal growth assays performed on peripheral blood from transgenic versus control mice revealed a marked reduction of myeloid progenitors, especially in those responding to granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and kit ligand cotreatment did not overcome this inhibition. Impaired myelopoiesis in vivo was shown by stressing these mice with sublethal irradiation. Following irradiation, PML/RARalpha transgenic mice, as compared with controls, more rapidly depressed peripheral white blood cell and granulocyte counts. As expected, nearly all control mice (94.4 %) survived irradiation, yet this irradiation was lethal to 45.8 % of PML/RARalpha transgenic mice. Lethality was associated with more severe leukopenia in transgenic versus control mice. Retinoic acid treatment of irradiated PML/RARalpha mice enhanced granulocyte recovery. These data suggest that abnormal myelopoiesis due to PML/RARalpha expression is an early event in oncogenic transformation.</p>
