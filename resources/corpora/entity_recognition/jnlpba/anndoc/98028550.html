					<p id = "s2s1p1">The JAK (Janus kinase) family of protein tyrosine kinases and the STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) have been shown to be activated in response to a number of cytokines and growth factors. In this study, we evaluated the activation of JAK /STAT pathway upon human interleukin-5 (hIL-5) stimulation of two different hIL-5-responsive cell lines, hIL-5 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL-5R alpha) cDNA-transfected TF-1 (TF-h5R alpha) and butyric-acid-treated YY-1 (YY-Bu), and peripheral eosinophils. Immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and activation of STAT5 were induced upon stimulation with hIL-5 in all three cell types, while STAT1 activation was only observed in eosinophils. These results indicate that JAK2 /STAT5 activation is a common JAK /STAT pathway for hIL-5 -mediated signal in these cells.</p>
