					<p id = "s2s1p1">The Pan gene encodes at least two distinct transcripts, Pan-1 and Pan-2 (also known as E47 and E12, respectively), by the mechanism of alternative RNA splicing. Northern blot analyses performed on rat and mouse tissues have detected ubiquitously expressed Pan transcripts, but the abundance, distribution, and form of Pan proteins have not been clearly defined. Studies of cell lines representing endocrine, fibroblast, and lymphoid lineages using polyclonal antisera to detect E2A proteins have suggested that significant E2A protein expression is restricted to B-lymphocytes. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, Yae, which is specific for Pan/E2A proteins, and have used the Yae antibody to examine a variety of endocrine and nonendocrine cell lineages for differences in Pan/ E2A protein expression, subcellular localization, and heteromeric complex formation. In contrast to previous results obtained using polyclonal antiseras to detect Pan/ E2A proteins, we report comparable levels of Pan proteins in GH/PRL- and insulin-producing, B- and T-lymphocyte cells. IEF-1, a pancreatic beta-cell type-specific complex believed to regulate insulin expression, is demonstrated to consist of at least two distinct species, one of which does not contain Pan molecules. Although it has been postulated that pituitary endocrine cells and pancreatic endocrine beta-cells share identical Pan/E2A complexes, native-Western analyses of pituitary and endocrine beta-cells detect Pan proteins in distinct cell type-specific complexes.</p>
