					<p id = "s2s1p1">The role of the protooncogene c-fos in interleukin (IL) 6 -induced B cell differentiation was assessed. Treatment of SKW 6.4 cells with IL 6 induced a transient and early stimulation of c-fos sense mRNA expression. The effect appeared within 30 min and returned to basal levels after 2 h. The addition of antisense oligonucleotides to c-fos significantly inhibited IL 6 -induced IgM production by SKW 6.4 cells (p less than 0.001), whereas control oligonucleotides had no inhibitory effect. These results indicate that activation of c-fos is involved in IL 6 -induced differentiation of SKW 6.4 cells into IgM-secreting cells.</p>
