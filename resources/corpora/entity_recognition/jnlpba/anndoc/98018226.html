					<p id = "s2p1">Dendritic cells (DC) are potent APCs that enter resting tissues as precursors and, after Ag exposure, differentiate and migrate to draining lymph nodes. The phenotype of RelB knockout mice implicates this member of the NF kappa B/Rel family in DC differentiation. To further elucidate the role of RelB in DC differentiation, mRNA, intracellular protein expression, and DNA binding activity of RelB were examined in immature and differentiated human DC, as well as other PB mononuclear cell populations. RelB protein and mRNA were detected constitutively in lymphocytes and in activated monocytes, differentiated DC, and monocyte-derived DC. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated RelB within the differentiated lymph node interdigitating DC and follicular DC, but not undifferentiated DC in normal skin. Active nuclear RelB was detected by supershift assay only in differentiated DC derived from either PB precursors or monocytes and in activated B cells. These RelB+ APC were potent stimulators of the MLR. The data indicate that RelB expression is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally in myeloid cells. Within the nucleus, RelB may specifically transactivate genes that are critical for APC function.</p>
